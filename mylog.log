Abstract = {The challenge of defining the domain and core concepts of the IS field is a perennial topic at major IS conferences. This paper describes the architecture of Sysperanto, a model-based ontology of the IS field. Sysperanto is being developed as part of an ongoing effort to create methods that typical business professionals can use to analyze systems and system-related projects for themselves at whatever level of depth is appropriate. The name Sysperanto is meant as a metaphor combining generality (covering the IS field), vocabulary (identification of terms), and structure (internally consistent organization) to create an ontology more powerful and useful than a list of keywords or propositions. Sysperanto's architecture provides an organizing framework for codifying the disparate and inconsistent propositions, methods, and findings that constitute the current state of IS knowledge and, in combination, form a major obstacle to knowledge accumulation and use in the IS field.  Instead of yet another discussion of whether the IS field lacks a conceptual core and what might be the consequences of such a shortcoming, this paper proposes an architecture and preliminary details of a plausible set of core concepts for the IS field. It starts by summarizing Sysperanto's goals and explaining why work system concepts, rather than information system concepts, are the core of Sysperanto. It presents Sysperanto as a terminological ontology and explains the underlying meta-model. The meta-model is designed to support tools for analyzing systems from a business viewpoint and to help in codifying and organizing knowledge in the IS field. It uses a conceptual map based on extensiveness and guidance in application to compare Sysperanto with other efforts to organize ideas in the IS field.   It may be several years before a complete version of Sysperanto is tested through its use in a formal method for analyzing systems or through comparison with other attempts to codify knowledge in the IS field. Nonetheless, its architecture is well enough defined to be compared to the architecture (or lack of architecture) in previous and future approaches for understanding and organizing the basic concepts about information systems.}

Abstract = {Online prescription filling possesses great market potential; however, consumers' perception of uncertainty tends to impede their adoption of online prescription filling. Trust is recognized as a critical factor affecting online shopping in general. We contend that trust can help consumers overcome perceived uncertainty, thereby enhancing their intention to adopt online prescription filling. Drawing on prior research on trust and theory of transaction cost economics, this paper proposes a research model that encompasses three trust antecedents, two sources of uncertainty, and the relationships among trust, uncertainty, and the consumer's intention to adopt online prescription filling. The model was tested empirically using a large sample. It was found that  (1)	calculus-based, knowledge-based, and institution-based trust antecedents significantly affect trust,  (2)	information asymmetry and online drug retailers' opportunistic behavior contribute to perceived uncertainty,  (3)	trust reduces uncertainty and positively affects intention, and  (4)uncertainty influences intention negatively.}

Abstract = {This study examines the effect of five factors on the adoption of electronic commerce among small and medium enterprises in Brunei Darussalam. A review of the literature shows that owner characteristics such as lack of perceived relative advantage, lack of knowledge, and perceived lack of trust are significant inhibitors while environment characteristics such as competitive pressure and, government support are significant motivators of electronic commerce in Brunei Darussalam. A questionnaire survey was conducted in 360 small and medium enterprises. A total of 184 valid responses were obtained. Stratified random sampling was adopted over other techniques to enhance representativeness. Data analysis shows that significant relationship exists between each of the five variables and electronic commerce adoption among small and medium enterprises in Brunei Darussalam. This study concludes that the five factors explain more than fifty percent of the variation in small and medium enterprises adoption. Competitive pressure emerged as the most important factor in terms of relative importance. This factor is followed by IT knowledge, relative advantage, security and government support.}

Abstract = {This paper provides a critical review to analyze the promises and important challenges of studying flow, a psychological state, in the computer-mediated environments (CME).  Despite the strong interest in IS, HCI, Marketing, Education, and other research disciplines over more than a decade, adapting the phenomenon of flow to computer users in the literature shows inconsistencies and discrepancies. Few studies attempted to provide a coherent picture of the area. Based on a careful examination of the literature, we identify both conceptual and methodological challenges (operationalization of the constructs and data collection methods) faced when studying flow in computer-mediated environments. Although not all challenges are solved in the literature, we point out directions and possible solutions for many challenges and call for more studies in this promising area.  The paper discusses implications for research in human computing behavior in general and in flow in particular. It cautions researchers to examine hidden assumptions of theories in other disciplines before applying them to address IS issues and concerns.}

Nonetheless, the most highly developed e-learning modes in academia are based on a classical pedagogical approach. This article analyses a learning method--andragogy--that is by definition more appropriate for adults. In addition, the validity of andragogy is assessed through mapping with the most widely used e-learning technologies.}

Abstract = {Healthcare facilities face limited resources and expanding expenses. Emerging information technologies offer a means for healthcare to measure and control their resources and workflow processes, and ultimately improve patient care. The usefulness of one emerging information technology, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), is examined in a "proof of application" study conducted at a Level-1 trauma unit. Results from the study suggest not only that RFID technology can assist in the measurement and ultimate control of workflow processes, but also that traditional and non-traditional IS practices are necessary for successful RFID implementation. Lessons learned about the idiosyncrasies of RFID implementation and the cleansing and analysis of RFID-generated data are reported.}

Abstract = {The outsourcing literature suggests that the capabilities of partners involved in outsourcing or off-shoring projects are a crucial factor for the success of the projects. This paper studies the capabilities of IS professionals from the USA and Taiwan on issues such as performance, time spent on IS related activities, and required skills vs. skills possessed. The goal is to determine the differences among these two groups in their core IT capabilities and to offer practitioners an empirical reference for carrying out their IS development decisions. Findings from the current study indicate that Taiwanese professionals tended to focus more on the technical issues and hardware/software details, while American professionals were proficient in business modeling, inter-personal communication, and end-user training. These findings present an opportunity for partnership between the two countries to develop low-cost but high quality IS projects. Other business implications are also discussed.}

Abstract = {This longitudinal research study investigates the teaching and research expectations for potential IS professors. Most university departments advertise for specific job skills and qualifications when they attempt to recruit faculty members. This study examines over 400 IS placement advertisements for the academic recruiting years 2001-2002, 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. Top teaching and research areas that universities are interested in for their new hires are identified. The study then investigates whether the interests of candidates seeking appointments are similar. Over 400 IS candidate doctorates' résumés are content analyzed and their teaching and research preferences are identified. By looking at the teaching and research needs of the universities and the preferences of IS candidates, it is then possible to identify if a gap exists between the two. Lists of (1) most required and (2) most desired IS teaching and research areas over the three year period are shown. The results report that in terms of teaching, what the universities are looking for is being well matched with what candidates are offering, except in the universities' demand for telecommunications. With respect to research, while there is some match between demand and supply, there is a noticeable lack of  demand by universities for e-Commerce, HCI and ERP.}

Abstract = {Cross-cultural IS research is beginning to mature; however, much is left to do. This article reviews the most popular conceptualization of National Culture and offers suggestions for improvements in measurement. While Hofstedefs culture dimensions  uncertainty avoidance, power distance, masculinity/femininity, and individualism/collectivism  are still widely used in many disciplines; it is not guaranteed that the measures still hold after over 30 years. Empirical evidence is presented from two studies that indicate that shifts might have occurred. Because the usual national culture constructs are measured at the national level, they also should not be used in individual models of behavior or technology acceptance.}

Abstract = {The introduction of a new network level protocol called Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) represents a significant step forward in the development of the Internet. While IPv6 offers a number of advantages over the current standard (IPv4), its adoption has been inconsistent, often varying by geographic and political region.  Through an investigation of early and late adopters of IPv6, this paper seeks to understand the factors that influence the time of adoption decision. The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, we interviewed Internet thought leaders.  Based on previous literature about the characteristics of early and late adopters, and characteristics specific to IPv6 derived from the interviews, we developed a set of initial notions describing the conditions that are likely to encourage early adoption of IPv6. In stage two we tested those conditions through interviews with eight ISPs in six countries. We found that relative advantage, uncertainty and risk, crisis, and power relationships influence an organization's time of adoption while organizational age does not impact the time of adoption. In addition, we found that sponsorship and availability of information indirectly affect time of adoption by mitigating the perceived risk of early adoption.}

Abstract = {This paper introduces a new concept, the software continuum concept based on the observation that exists a general parallelism between the software continuum from bits to business/Internet ecosystems and the natural continuum from particles to ecosystems. The general parallelism suggests that homeomorphisms may be identified and therefore some concepts, processes, and/or mechanisms in one continuum can be investigated for application in the other continuum. We argue that the homeomorphisms give rise to a biologically-inspired architectural framework for addressing robust control, robust intelligence, and robust autonomy issues in e-business software and other business-IT integration challenges. As application, we examine the mapping of a major enterprise-level architecture framework to the biologically-inspired framework. Design considerations for robust intelligence and autonomy in large-scale software automation and some major systemic features for flexible business-IT integration are also discussed.}

Abstract = {One of the challenges in teaching information systems analysis and design is setting up experiential learning projects in which students have an opportunity to apply and reinforce the theories and techniques they have acquired in the classroom. This note aims to shed light on this issue and to offer Appreciative Inquiry as an alternative to the prevailing problem solving lens. The Accelerated Systems Analysis and Design with Appreciative Inquiry Workshop revolves around a genuine system design project, which provides an opportunity to apply the latest systems analysis and design methodologies in a realistic setting and to gain hands-on experience in a safe learning environment. Building on the principles of Appreciative Inquiry, the workshop is designed to emphasize collaborative work in the pursuit of both organizational and personal value. The workshop provides not only a framework for looking at organizations and organizational life, but also a language to communicate their dynamic complexities and interdependencies. Overall, participants gain a balanced mix of formal theory, critical thinking, and hands on experience, which prepare them for effective communication and participation in system development in organizational settings.}

Abstract = {As information technology becomes increasingly embedded in critical business processes, IS professionals continually seek to improve the security, reliability and performance of the systems for which they are responsible.  Systems and network applications vendors are unveiling a wide array of new products designed to assist in this effort and the trade literature is devoting significant coverage to the IT operations processes required to achieve required IT service levels.  Despite increasing industry attention to the importance of IS operations, the authors believe that such concerns are relatively unaddressed in the typical undergraduate business-oriented IS curriculum.  This article describes  a  course currently offered at the authors' university that conceptualizes the enterprise management of IS as including both IS governance and IS management processes.  The distinction allows for coverage of traditional content related to the strategic use of information technology while providing an increased focus on IT operational management issues.}

Abstract = {Business students often find it difficult to understand the relevance of the traditional core MIS course taught as part of most business curricula. To address this problem, we made several changes to how we teach IS to business students. One of those changes consists of using cross-course projects that require the application of IS tools and concepts. This article explains one such project that is jointly assigned in an IS course and in a Finance course. In this project, students apply their understanding of financial markets and investments by selecting a set of company stocks that they then manage as a mutual fund. They must build an information system both to track their fund performance and to allow entering of buy and sell transactions. The project is popular among the students, and it reinforces numerous IS concepts and skills.}

Abstract = {The Global Diffusion of the Internet (GDI) framework is used to examine Internet diffusion in Togo along six dimensions: Pervasiveness, Geographical Dispersion, Sectoral Absorption, Connectivity Infrastructure, Organizational Infrastructure, and Sophistication of Use.  The Internet in Togo originated in the private sector in 1996.  In the years that followed, the Togolese Internet grew at a slower rate than the Internet in many other countries over the same period of time.  After examining how each dimension evolved, this study concludes, amongst many suggestions, that the Togolese government should encourage more telecommunication infrastructure development by allowing private companies to utilize Togo Telecom's network.}

Abstract = {This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the technical and business implications of adopting Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in organizational settings. The year 2004 marked a significant shift toward adopting RFID because of mandates by large retailers and government organizations. The use of RFID technology is expected to increase rapidly in the next few years. At present, however, initial barriers against widespread adoption include standards, interoperability, costs, forward compatibility, and lack of familiarity. This paper describes basic components of an RFID system including tags, readers, and antennas and how they work together using an integrated supply chain model. Our analysis suggests that business needs to overcome human resource scarcity, security, legal and financial challenges and make informed decision regarding standards and process reengineering. The technology is not fully mature and suffers from issues of attenuation and interference. A laboratory experiment conducted by the authors' shows that the middleware is not yet at a "plug-and-play" stage, which means that initial adopters need to spend considerable effort to integrate RFID into their existing business processes. Appendices contain a glossary of common RFID terms, a list of RFID vendors and detailed findings of the laboratory experiment.

Abstract = {Educating management students in technology-based disciplines can be enhanced through experiential team projects simulating the activities employees perform in actual technology jobs. This paper describes an experiential team project the authors use in the Management Information Systems course at Boston College. The project was developed jointly by Boston College faculty and consultants from the Boston office of a major consulting firm. The project involves student teams playing the roles of IT consultants who must compete against one another to win a consulting engagement at an imaginary company. The company's business situation is communicated to students through a case study written in the format of a Request For Proposal (RFP) informing information technology (IT) vendors that the company is interested in procuring a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Each student team develops a consulting proposal responding to the RFP and presents the proposal to company managers. The activities involved in identifying the company's business needs, developing a proposal, and determining which team "wins" the contract are simulated through phone calls and live meetings with company managers, who are role-played by consulting firm employees. These real-life business interactions expose students to the ever changing nature of IT, motivate them to improve their technical understanding, and challenge them to improve their communication skills through written deliverables and live business presentations. Student buy-in and response to the project is strong and immediate since they find themselves challenged by complex, relevant business issues.}

Abstract = {A group of industry experts was assembled as a Delphi panel in 1997-1998.  They were asked to predict the effect that Electronic Commerce technologies and disintermediation and reintermediation would exert on the major firms in the U.S. air travel distribution industry in each of five major market segments.   The panel forecast that major disintermediation and reintermediation would occur and that there would be a sharp reduction in the number of traditional travel agents five and ten years in the future.  The panel also identified a number of strategic threats and opportunities for the channel participants.  This paper compares the panel's predictions to what actually occurred and describes technology-related developments that the panel did not foresee.  In particular, the panel predicted a major reduction in the number of travel agent entities between 1997 and 2002, as well as in 2007.   By the end of 2002, the panel's forecast was very close to what actually occurred.   Our overall conclusion is that the Delphi method worked well as a predictor in this instance.}

Abstract = {A guiding premise of academic scholarship is that knowledge gained from first-hand research experience is disseminated to students via the classroom.  However, that valuable connection is lost when professors are not researching what they teach.  In this paper, we explore issues of mismatch between teaching and research in the Information Systems (IS) discipline.  Specifically, while systems analysis and design (SA&D) is an integral topic in IS curricula, this topic is the research specialty of few IS professors.  This situation is reflected by the low number of research publications in this area; particularly in the leading mainstream IS journals.  We characterize the gap between teaching and research in SA&D, offer possible explanations for this gap, suggest avenues to better understand and enhance SA&D research via the design science paradigm, list a number of areas in SA&D in which there is ample need and opportunity for high quality research, and show through an example how a research mindset can be incorporated in a graduate level SA&D course.}

Abstract = {Providing personalized services for mobile commerce (m-commerce) can improve user satisfaction and merchant profits, which are important to the success of m-commerce. This paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN)-based framework for personalization in m-commerce applications. The framework helps to identify the target mobile users and to deliver relevant information to them at the right time and in the right way. Under the framework, a personalization model is generated using a new method and the model is implemented in an m-commerce application for the food industry. The new method is based on function dependencies of a relational database and rough set operations. The framework can be applied to other industries such as movies, CDs, books, hotel booking, flight booking, and all manner of shopping settings.}

Abstract = {Incorporating a human computer interaction (HCI) perspective into the systems development life cycle (SDLC) is necessary to information systems (IS) success and, in turn, to the success of businesses. However, modern SDLC models are based more on organizational needs than human needs. The human interaction aspect of an information system is usually considered far too little (only the screen interface) and far too late in the IS development process (only at the design stage). Thus, often a gap exists between satisfying organizational needs and supporting and enriching human users. This problem can be addressed by carefully integrating HCI development into the SDLC process to achieve a truly human-centered IS development approach. This paper examines the roles of HCI in systems development, justifies the importance of considering HCI through out the entire systems development life cycle, presents a methodology for human-centered IS development, and demonstrates how to apply this methodology to develop human-centered information systems.}

Abstract = {To protect the information assets of organizations, many different standards and guidelines have been proposed. Among them, International standard ISO 17799 is one of the most prominent international efforts on information security. This standard provides both an authoritative statement on information security and the procedures to be adopted by organizations to ensure information security.  Security professionals claim ISO 17799 to be a suitable model for information security management and an appropriate vehicle for addressing information security management issues in the modern organization.  However, to our knowledge, no empirical studies have been conducted to validate this standard. Based on a survey of information security professionals, we found that ISO 17799 is comprehensive, but not parsimonious.}

Abstract = {The implementation literature shows that many organizations are able to install enterprise systems (ES), in the sense that they make the system available for use, but failed in their efforts to diffuse and incorporate the system throughout the organization's daily practices. This difficulty is not new. It is wever, the special characteristics of ES re-motivate an enquiry into issues of technological diffusion and the related areas of learning. This research identifies and describes the process and key actions associated with the diffusion of ES. The presentation focuses on two key case studies. The methodology utilizes in-depth case studies for constructing theory from the observed field data. The ES diffusion model presented puts use amidst a network of knowledge flows and learning episodes. This new perspective puts more emphasis on the importance of experiential learning than some accounts and reaffirms the vital role of knowledge creation and sharing. The studies also show how the diffusion of ES throughout the organizations was an iterative, cumulative, and virtuous process over time. Finally, the studies confirm that it is the different dimensions of business adaptation and  system configuration and tailoring, that represent the authentic signature of the ES implementation experience.}

Abstract = {With the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States in 2002, and an ever-increasing corporate focus on ensuring prudent returns on technology investments, the notion of IT governance became a major issue for both business practitioners and academics.  Although the term "IT governance" is a relatively new addition to the syntax of academic research, significant previous work is reported on IT decisions rights and IT loci of control, notions that are synonymous with the current understanding of IT governance. This paper presents a literature review for existing research in IT governance.  A framework, named the Conceptual Framework For IT Governance Research is proposed to provide a logical structure for existing research results.  Using this framework, we classify the previous literature on governance into two separate streams that follow parallel paths of advancement.  A popular contemporary notion of IT governance is then presented, together with the argument that this new notion, by implicitly extending both streams of research, represents an initial amalgamation of the two paths of literature.  We conclude that even with the consideration of contemporary structures, academicians and practitioners alike continue to explore the concept of IT governance in an attempt to find appropriate mechanisms to govern corporate IT decisions.}

Abstract = {Limiting the focus of risk analysis to quantifiable factors and using a narrow understanding of the scope of a software project are major contributors to significant software failures. A Software Development Impact Statement (SoDIS) process is presented which extends the concept of software risk in three ways;  	--it moves beyond the limited approach of schedule, budget, and function,  	--it adds qualitative elements, and  	--it recognizes project stakeholders beyond those considered in typical risk analysis.  	 As the types of risks increase the range of stakeholders that need to be considered also expands. Using this expanded view of risk analysis reduced or eliminated the impacts of many previously undetected risks of software development. The SoDIS process and its software associated development tasks with relevant stakeholders through the application of structured questions.   This process was incorporated effectively into the software development life cycle and applied to software development projects in different domains on several continents. The successes of the SoDIS process provide strong evidence that a significant side-effect of narrowing project objectives is a root cause of IT project failures.}

However, using qualitative research we investigated the attitudes of a diverse set of individuals to personal web usage. Our findings suggest that personal web usage in the workplace can be potentially constructive, although we acknowledge the potential for negative uses as well. We suggest an extension of social contract theory to explain these findings.}

Abstract = {The Internet in developing countries grew substantially in recent years. Given the large income disparities and low telephone penetration. rates in most Latin American countries, only about 4% of the region's population can access the Internet. The International Telecommunication Union reports that teledensity (the number of telephone land-lines per 100 people) in Latin America is currently at about 10.8%. Prior research identified specific factors that hinder growth of teledensity in developing countries and specific strategies used to overcome such limitations. This study investigates Latin American telecommunication stakeholders' perspective of how these strategies can be used to address teledensity growth in the region. Survey participants (Latin America's telecommunications stakeholders) analyzed the strategies critically and modified, enhanced, or added new insights. Using appropriate statistical procedures we examined the telecommunications stakeholders' perceptions to find potential solutions the low teledensity problem. Qualitative comments to support the stakeholders' responses are reported, together with future research implications.}

Abstract = {A major challenge for healthcare is how to provide improved services to an increasing number of people using limited financial and human resources. Pervasive healthcare is considered a solution to many existing problems and a possible future of the current healthcare services. In simple terms, pervasive healthcare can be defined as healthcare to anyone, anytime, and anywhere by removing locational, time and other restraints while increasing both its coverage and quality. The broad definition includes prevention, healthcare maintenance and checkups, short-term monitoring (or home healthcare monitoring), long-term monitoring (nursing home), personalized healthcare monitoring, incidence detection and management, and, emergency intervention, transportation and treatment. These requirements could be effectively supported by universal, efficient and reliable access to healthcare services, providers, and biomedical information that is available at any time. In this paper, several pervasive healthcare applications and related challenges are discussed. An integrated wireless architecture that is designed to use the capabilities of current and emerging wireless and mobile networks for location management, intelligent emergency system, patient monitoring, and mobile telemedicine applications is presented.}

Abstract = {The growth of unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE) imposes increasing costs on organizations and causes considerable aggravation on the part of e-mail recipients. A thriving anti-spam industry addresses some of the frustration. Regulation and various economic and technical means are in the works. All anti-spam measures aim at bringing down the flood of unwanted commercial e-mail.  This paper draws on scholarly work in marketing, resource ownership, and use.  Adapting the tragedy of the commons concept to e-mail, we identify a causal structure that drives the direct e-marketing industry. Computer simulations indicate that although filtering may be an effective method to curb UCE arriving at individual inboxes, it is likely to increase the aggregate volume, thereby boosting overall costs.  We also examine other response mechanisms, including self-regulation, government regulation, and market mechanisms. We find that, of the various countermeasures, filtering appears to be the best currently available but that none are a satisfactory solution. The analysis advances understanding of the digital commons, the economics of UCE, and provides practical implications for the direct e-marketing industry.}

Abstract = {Given the growing concern over information privacy abuse, potential lawsuits, and threats of increased government privacy legislation, an increasing number of firms are resorting to Chief Privacy Officers (CPOs) as a means to cope with information privacy. However, little is yet known about the job responsibilities and roles of this emerging corporate position. This study examines the critical managerial roles of CPOs. Drawing from in-depth interviews at three large firms and from  secondary sources of data, this study uses Mintzberg's framework for managerial work to develop a taxonomy of key managerial roles for the emerging position of Chief Privacy Officer. From our analysis, we conclude that Chief Privacy Officers function with role responsibilities in four main areas: informational (monitor, disseminator, spokesperson), interpersonal (figurehead, liaison), conflict management (disturbance handler, negotiator), and strategic management (entrepreneur). Our analysis also suggests that no single managerial role is most important. Rather, multiple roles are required of CPOs. To meet these multiple role requirements, effective CPOs must possess strong business, communications, and technical skills. Our results suggest that Chief Privacy Officers tend to operate at high levels of organizational hierarchies as evidenced by the importance of their externally related job roles of figurehead, liaison, and spokesperson.}

Abstract = {In 1999, Rose et al. identified six categories of technological impediments inhibiting the growth of electronic commerce: (1) download delays, (2) interface limitations, (3) search problems, (4) inadequate measures of Web application success, (5) security, and (6) a lack of Internet standards.  This paper updates findings in the original paper by surveying the practitioner literature for the five-year period from June 1999 to June 2004.  We identify how advances in technology both partially resolve concerns with the original technological impediments, and inhibit their full resolution.  We find that, despite five years of technological progress, the six categories of technological impediments remain relevant.  Furthermore, the maturation of e-Commerce increased the Internet's complexity, making these impediments harder to address.  Two kinds of complexity are especially relevant: 	evolutionary complexity, and  	skill complexity.    Evolutionary complexity refers to the need to preserve the existing Internet and resolve impediments simultaneously.  Unfortunately, because the Internet consists of multiple incompatible technologies, philosophies, and attitudes, additions to the Internet infrastructure are difficult to integrate.  Skill complexity refers to the skill sets necessary for managing e-Commerce change.  As the Internet evolves, more skills become relevant.  Unfortunately, individuals, companies and organizations are unable to master and integrate all necessary skills.  As a result, new features added to the Internet do not consider all relevant factors, and are thus sub-optimal. NOTE THAT THIS ARTICLE IS APPROXIMATELY 600kb.

Abstract = {The information systems academic discipline faced a sharp reduction in student enrollments as the job market for undergraduate students softened. This article examines the recent and rapid rise and fall of university student enrollments in information systems programs and describes how these enrollment fluctuations are tied to the job opportunities of graduates.  Specifically, we examine the role that global outsourcing is playing on the employment opportunities, both in the United States and Europe.  This analysis concludes that the demand for information systems graduates in the United States likely bottomed out and slow growth is now occurring. In Europe, general conclusions are limited, but it appears that global outsourcing is playing much less a role in Europe than in the United States.  Nevertheless, although global outsourcing is indeed a factor influencing the U.S. employment picture, it is only one of several factors that impacted the U.S. job market for information systems graduates negatively over the past few years. After examining the future job opportunities for information systems graduates from a macro viewpoint, the paper provides recommendations for improving student recruiting to the information systems major, for attracting potential employers of graduates, and for managing the production of Ph.D. graduates to match the flow of undergraduate demand.  The article concludes that, although shaken, the information systems academic discipline is strong and will continue to strengthen as it moves into a state of maturity and relative equilibrium.}

Abstract = {This case describes the privacy issues surrounding Giant Food's decision to outsource a prescription drug compliance program to Elensys.  Under the arrangement, Elensys would send refill reminders to Giant's pharmacy customers.  As approximately half of all patients stop taking their medication within the first six months of being prescribed, compliance programs which remind patients to refill their prescriptions help address a major public health issue.  However, these programs also raise privacy issues because they involve the reuse of sensitive personal information. The case provides students with an opportunity to assess the privacy issues raised by this situation.  The case also provides an opportunity for students to grapple with the challenges of developing a "privacy sensitive" implementation strategy for Giant and for CRM programs more generally.}

The system can automatically provide detailed evaluations of the performance, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, diagnostic accuracy, ROC curve, and area under the curve (Az). Based on a preliminary evaluation of the system, we found that ROC analysis is appropriate for a real-time computer application, directly using the raw data from a database, to evaluate the performance of radiology residents.}

Abstract = {IS academics are under increasing pressure to apply for national competitive grants, internal university grants, and industry funding to support their research programs. This paper presents an investigation of the nature of DSS research funding through the analysis of 1,020 papers published in 14 high quality journals from 1990 to 2003. In the sample, 23.6% of DSS papers acknowledged grant support, 14.7% were supported by major competitive grants, and only 5.1% received industry grant support. This level of grant funding may be a major problem for the DSS field. Even more worrying is the finding that overall grant support is falling over time. The detailed analysis of DSS research funding shows what types of DSS are grant-funded, where the grant-funded papers are published, what paradigms and methods are grant-funded in DSS research, the relationship between research quality and funding type, and the relationship between grant funding and research relevance. The findings and conclusions relate to DSS research, but because of the proportion of IS research that concerns DSS, they are also important for IS research in general.}

Abstract = {When managers and stockholders consider making an investment in information technology (IT), as with any other investment, a major concern is whether this investment will add to the performance of their organization.  However, it is difficult to identify the nature of the linkage between an investment in IT in general, and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), in particular, to an organization's performance. In this study we extend the work of Barua et al. , Lerch and Mangal, and Tallon et al. We develop a model to identify the value ERP applications add to Porter's organizational primary activities and the information systems (IS) applications related to ERP that help deliver added value through organizational characteristics. This new model should help in  assessing the potential value of an ERP investment.   We examine the relationship of ERP applications and organizational characteristics to an organization's primary activities by a path analysis of more than 200 medium and large sized manufacturing firms.  The results of this investigation indicate that organizational characteristics mediate the relationship between IS applications and the value ERP can add to the organizational primary activities. Consequently, organizations with different characteristics may add different value to their primary activities by using ERP applications.  We found that each primary activity was supported by some, though not necessarily all, IS applications included in most ERP packages.  We conclude that, an organization's characteristics are related to the return that may be gained from the use of ERP systems.  We offer recommendations on how organizations can use ERP to add value to their primary activities, based on their organizational characteristics.}

Abstract = {With the deployment of 3G and 4G mobile networks, a sizable proportion of e-commerce traffic is expected to move to these networks. These transactions are likely to be diverse. Mobile transactions can include unique requirements such as atomicity (all or none steps), push or pull, security, and privacy. Because users are mobile, unpredictable link characteristics, and other problems associated with wireless networks, some mobile commerce transactions may not be completed causing significant annoyance to the users affected. Therefore, the probability of completing mobile transactions is an important parameter for measuring quality-of-service of a network supporting mobile commerce. The transaction completion probability measures the ability of networks to support completion of transactions. This research focuses on improving the support of mobile commerce transactions by the underlying wireless networks. Mobile commerce traffic is classified as messaging, information connectivity, and transactions in order to provide efficient quality-of-service to various applications. This paper introduces the use of priority, sociability and delegation to improve the transaction completion in wireless networks.}

Allocating course-sections to prescribed "time slots" for courses requires advanced quantitative techniques, such as goal programming, and collecting a large amount of multi-criteria data at least six to eight months in advance of a semester.  This study takes an alternate approach.  It demonstrates the feasibility of applying the principles of data mining. Specifically it uses association rules to evaluate a  non-standard ("aberrant") timetabling pilot study undertaken in one College at a University.  The results indicate that 1), inductive methods are indeed applicable, 2), both summary and detailed results can be understood by key decision-makers, and 3), straightforward, repeatable SQL queries can be used as the chief analytical technique on a recurring basis.  In addition, this study was one of the first empirical studies to provide an accurate measure of the discernable, but negligible, scheduling exclusionary effects that may impact course availability and diversity negatively.}

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of handheld computers on students in a first year Information Technology course (IT101), measuring IT attitudes, skills, and performance. Students in standard sections used their laptop computers and traditional textbooks. Students in intensive sections used both handheld computers and laptop computers, that is, multiple platforms. Both standard and intensive sections covered the same topics. Although students in both standard and intensive sections became more skilled during the semester, students in the intensive sections improved more in programming and Microsoft Excel skills. Students in intensive sections also scored significantly better than students in the standard sections on the common portion of the final exam. Finally, according to anecdotal evidence, students in the intensive sections gained significantly more skill-based confidence in IT unrelated to handheld computers compared to students in the standard sections. Seven of our ten expectations were supported. While students benefited from the intensive version of IT101, several factors could account for the improvements: a self-selection factor, an active learning vs. textbook learning factor, and possibly an instructor factor. Future research should shed light on the relative weights of these factors.}

Abstract = {Xpedite was a computer-based information system developed by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to enhance organ procurement and placement from cadavers.  Using state-of-the-art development approaches and technology at the time of its development, Xpedite was built around Lotus Notes,  facsimile machines, and alphanumeric pagers.  It was developed to integrate and streamline the collection, transfer, and exchange of data on available organs more fully. The concept was to shorten the time from organ availability (i.e., donor death) to transplant, thus reducing organ wastage.  Xpedite met design and operational performance goals (i.e., a reduction in placement times and data errors), yet its operation was terminated after barely twenty-four months of operation.  Adoption of the new technology throughout the transplant community was limited due to inexperience with integrated information technology systems and the resistance to change that accompanied Xpedite's launch.  The individual and organizational resistance was a surprise to UNOS.  The technical and organizational lessons learned from this experience helped UNOS with developing subsequent information technology infrastructure components.  The complexity of the technology support environment and low levels of user adoption for Xpedite ultimately led to an evolution beyond this tool, resulting in an Internet-based environment that would be more robust, easier to maintain, and better able to support user needs.}

It is based on qualitative analysis of  U.S. industry survey data, matched to a similar data and analyses from other countries. It presents data taken from one of the most comprehensive sample surveys of U.S. firm activity in e-commerce.  The paper analyzes differences among three industry sectors, and between small/medium and large firms using both qualitative interpretations and direct observations from the survey data, as well as use of structural equation modeling of e-commerce diffusion and impacts.   Some differences in e-commerce orientation and experience were found across the three industry sectors studied in the survey. These differences are related largely to the nature of the tasks done in the respective industries, and to prior industry-level investment and learning related to e-commerce. There were also differences found in e-commerce attitudes and experience between small/medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and large establishments. Only modest differences were found between U.S. and non-U.S. establishments.  Quantitative analysis revealed significant regression relationships with their level of statistical significance. Results show that e-commerce adoption is path dependent (i.e., establishments follow earlier investment patterns), and that each industry's market and institutional context play a significant role in adoption.}

The regression results indicate that several factors are significantly related to starting salary including internship experience, GPA, job market, and size of employer.  Internship experience was found to play a particularly strong role in predicting MIS starting salaries.  A significant interaction effect indicates that the positive effect of internship experience is stronger during a weak job market.

Abstract = {Business enterprises continue to globalize, motivated by their search for new markets, greater efficiency in the use of resources, and greater competitiveness. Information systems and technologies serve as one of the critical success factors for making this possible.  Some IS curricula supported this development by either integrating more globalization into current courses or by delivering stand-alone courses in Global IS Management as electives or requirements.  The purpose of this paper is to review and propose "best practices" for the Global IS Management course, and consider contingencies that can be expected to influence the choice and success of various approaches.  The paper provides a categorization of such courses based on differences in education level (graduate/undergraduate) and student population (MIS/InternationalBusiness/ mixed).  We discuss experiences with approaches and practices that work across these segments, and activities targeted to each segment.   The paper revisits and argues for the need to expand this curriculum, and provides practical details for MIS faculty who seek to integrate it into their own programs.}

Abstract = {The e-government field, like most young fields, lacks a strong body of well-developed theory. One strategy for coping with theoretical immaturity is to import and adapt theories from other, more mature fields. This study reviews Stakeholder Theory (ST) and investigates its potential in relation to e-Government. Originally a management theory, stakeholder theory advocates addressing the concerns of all stakeholders in a firm, as opposed to concentration on the interests of senior managers and stockholders. Apart from its original profit focus, there is no serious conceptual mismatch between stakeholder theory and government's objective of providing policy and services for citizens and organizations - society's stakeholders. Potential problems with adapting a management theory to a government setting are discussed. The paper further discusses how information technology impacts a stakeholder model of governance. Finally, the paper makes recommendations for future work in adapting ST to the e-government context.}

Abstract = {While information and communication technologies can increase the health care provided to underserved populations, research concerning these technologies often involves only those patients who possess access to technology or who are otherwise willing and able to use it. This issue is important for both researchers and practitioners because non-users' beliefs may not only be different from users' beliefs, they may become more important to understand as access to technology increases. To address this problem: 1. We develop a model of the antecedents to perceived usefulness of an interactive health communication (IHC) system. While our research model combines health-related beliefs with technology perceptions, the antecedents can all be measured before an individual has contact with a particular IHC system. Thus, in the current (and in future) work, they can be used to assess the beliefs of individuals who may not currently be willing or able to use technology. 2. We test this model using paper-based scenarios that depict hypothetical interactions with an IHC system. These paper-based scenarios are more flexible and easier to use than a working system, thus we are able to obtain data from many sources, resulting in a perceptually diverse sample. Results of our hypothesis testing show that patients with higher knowledge and discipline are less likely than those with less knowledge and/or discipline to find an IHC system useful. In addition we learned several lessons from our research process including how to increase participation rates and what reactions to expect from participants.}

Abstract = {This paper examines the root causes of Knowledge Management (KM) project abandonment.  The authors use root cause analysis to identify the causes of KM project abandonment in five well-documented cases of KM drawn from the literature.  The findings are synthesized into a Cause-Effect Diagram (CED), culminating in a causal model of KM project abandonment.  The model identifies three major categories for causes of KM project abandonment, namely (1) poor project implementation, (2) mismatch between the KM project and the organization's strategy or existing structure, and (3) content deficiencies related to the creation, capture and access of knowledge content.  These three major categories of causes are iteratively refined and eventually root causes emerge.  KM project abandonment is compared with IS project failure, and the implications for risk management practices for KM projects are discussed.}

Abstract = {With the emergence of free and open source software (F/OSS) projects (e.g. Linux) as serious contenders to well-established proprietary software, advocates of F/OSS are quick to generalize the superiority of this approach to software development.  On the other hand, some well-established software development firms view F/OSS as a threat and vociferously refute the claims of F/OSS advocates. This article represents a tutorial on F/OSS that tries objectively to identify and present open source software's concepts, benefits, and challenges.  From our point of view, F/OSS is more than just software. We conceptualize it as an IPO system that consists of the license as the boundary of the system, the community that provides the input, the development process, and the software as the output.  After describing the evolution and definition of F/OSS, we identify three approaches to benefiting from F/OSS that center on (1) the software, (2) the community, and (3) the license respectively. Each approach is fit for a specific situation and provides a unique set of benefits and challenges. We further illustrate our points by refuting common misconceptions associated with F/OSS based upon our conceptual framework.}

Abstract = {Organizations analyze their business processes in order to improve them. Business processes are also considered retainers, users and creators of organizational knowledge. Thus, they can be analyzed to identify the knowledge used, created and embedded in them. A process analysis approach that focuses on redesign does not necessarily capture the knowledge used and created in a process. Choosing a knowledge-focused approach should lead to understanding knowledge needs but might not lead to improved business processes. This paper describes an approach for Knowledge Requirements Analysis (KRA) that combines process analysis with identifying knowledge used and created during the process. KRA is the process of identifying and analyzing existing organizational knowledge and prescribing improvements to it. The KRA methodology presented in this paper combines two methods: a knowledge engineering method (CommonKADS) and a process modeling method (EDPDT). The EDPDT constructs are used to operationalize the organization and task models of CommonKADS and thus create the KRA methodology. The methodology was applied successfully to the process of ethical reviews of grant applications in a university. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is that it enables organizations to keep track of their knowledge resources embedded in various business processes. Knowledge that is not shared or used can be detected and new knowledge can be identified to support and improve existing processes better. This approach can lead to improved knowledge management in organizations}

Abstract = {The software analysis process consists of two main activities: data modeling and functional modeling. While traditional development methodologies usually emphasize functional modeling via dataflow diagrams (DFDs), object-oriented (OO) methodologies emphasize data modeling via class diagrams. UML includes techniques for both data and functional modeling which are used in different methodologies in different ways and orders. This article is concerned with the ordering of modeling activities in the analysis stage. The main issue we address is whether it is better to create a functional model first and then a data model, or vice versa. We conduct a comparative experiment in which the two opposing orders are examined. We use the FOOM methodology as a platform for the experiment as it enables the creation of both a data model (a class diagram) and a functional model (hierarchical OO-DFDs), which are synchronized. The results of the experiment show that an analysis process that begins with data modeling provides better specifications than one that begins with functional modeling.}

We offer ways to transition to a curriculum that emphasizes the OO philosophy of development.}

Abstract = {The evaluation of information systems development methodologies is becoming increasingly important. Some researchers propose their own criteria for conceptual evaluations. But such criteria are often constrained by the limitation of the researcher's view toward and experience with development methodologies. Furthermore, existing evaluation criteria are either not practical for direct measurement or not tested for validity and reliability. The lack of a generally acceptable, practically valid, and reliable set of criteria for evaluation hinders the development of knowledge in this area. Our study is a step toward developing a systematic process to evaluate information systems development methodologies. We captured the opinions of a group of twenty-eight researchers and practitioners who are experienced in information systems development methodologies. Through a systematic content analysis, the authors classified these criteria into three categories:  (1) methodology design, (2) methodology use, and (3) methodology deliverables. The three categories of criteria are not totally separate in that they represent the means and goals of information systems development methodologies. Appropriate criteria should be applied depending on the stages when evaluation is performed.}

Abstract = {The disaffection of information technology managers with IT strategy development and planning goes back a long way. The research that identifies this dissatisfaction is examined briefly.   The technology strategy and planning problem is shown to be multi-faceted, with several possible causes that may be operating simultaneously in a particular company.  A major ingredient of the problem is the alignment/linkage of IT planning and plans, and the business plans.  For IT planners to achieve the desired linkage requires that the planners possess a deep understanding of their company's business planning.  Similarly, business managers must possess solid knowledge of their company's IT planning.  Using Kiviat Diagrams, business planning approaches are shown to be bewildering in their variety. This variety indicates that IT planning managers must find it difficult to decipher business planning in general and the nature of their company's business planning in particular.  Nine approaches to plan alignment and linkage are explored, each with respect to its possible value for linking IT planning and plans to business planning and plans.  The development of a Theory of Plan Linkages is proposed.    Several sources of the problem are suggested, and several IT management approaches to IT planning are explored briefly.  It is unlikely that any single set of IT planning activities can deal satisfactorily with the problem for most companies.   Efforts are proposed for developing best practices for IT planning.  Steps are proposed for use by IT planners to improve their company's IT strategy development processes.  Areas that merit further academic research are explored.}

In this paper, we take a two-pronged qualitative approach to establish an integrated set of criteria for reviewers, for the reviews they produce, and for the papers they review in the IS domain. These criteria are intended to be of value to three sets of stakeholders: authors, reviewers and editors. Authors should find them useful as they write, knowing in advance how reviewers are evaluating their work; reviewers should find them useful to improve the quality of the reviews of manuscripts; editors should use them to ensure that manuscripts are well written and that reviewers performed their tasks effectively. We discuss the implications of these criteria for the review process and identify areas for future research.}

Abstract = {Disaster recovery planning for organizations is fundamental and often urgent.  Planning supports the firm's ability to recover the core business functionality of its software, data,  and systems after the occurrence of a natural or man-made disaster. Organizations must take steps to protect their software, systems and data backups from natural disasters, power outages, and even terrorist attacks. However the issue of disaster recovery is often awash in checklists or marooned in mundane statistics. Such sterile approaches tend to lead key managers, CEOs, and CIOs to relegate disaster recovery planning to a lower priority when they become overwhelmed with planning minutiae or bored with staid presentations. This paper introduces a theatre metaphor to enable a lively discussion and deeper understanding of disaster recovery planning. Specifically, we introduce the concept of workshopping a play. We explore this new approach from the world of theatrical productions to illuminate and deepen understanding of the importance of testing, evaluation, and reworking of scenarios for each potential disaster.}

Abstract = {Existing literature on IT standards focuses on the role of technical factors such as network effects and competitive behavior on the creation of standards.  However, the role of users and vendors in initiating the standards definition and ratification process is less well understood. Given the advantages associated with standards, all users and vendors of IT products would be expected to be glad to participate in the standards definition and ratification process. However, if that were the case, many fewer proprietary technologies would compete. This paper explains qualitatively why users, vendors, and government bodies choose (or don't choose) to participate in the standards definition and ratification process. A better understanding of their motivations for participating or not in the process should help to attract more participants to the process. The paper concludes by analyzing strategies to recover the cost of standards definition and ratification process, and their impact on the standards adoption rate.}

Abstract = {Mobile communication technologies are changing every aspect of the daily life, bringing new opportunities in many areas. Several converging mobile systems can potentially change organizations significantly by shifting the traditional boundaries of work-life and the workplace. Mobile telephony, combining satellite and terrestrial cellular systems, already transformed the way people work by allowing 'anytime/anywhere' telephone calling and text messaging. Broadband mobile telephony opens additional avenues to provide information conveniently as quickly and easily as possible, when needed and where needed. The evolution of wireless technologies (from Wireless Personal Area Networks to ubiquitous Third Generation/Universal Mobile Telecommunication System - UMTS) increased the number of services available to business organizations and mobile workers. Machine-to-machine, vertical applications, and mobile office applications are increasingly being deployed. Service providers and mobile operators are also changing the way they operate as a result of the increasing availability of mobile broadband communication services. IT departments need to change their systems, upgrade, and adapt their infrastructure and policies to support these mobile services. These changes are both positive and negative. With this progression, some fundamental questions related to privacy, security, and a new concept of work place and work space are raised. The implications for developing economies, such as China, and their potential for leapfrogging are future attention areas.}

We review and compare the various authentication mechanisms of these approaches and the technology and implementation issues they involve. Our conclusion is that there is no silver bullet solution to user authentication problems. Authentication practices need improvement.  Further research should lead to a better understanding of user behavior and the applied psychology aspects of computer security.}

Abstract = {High levels of investments in IT and related products and services by firms over the last several decades produced only mixed results.  Research shows that one of the most significant determinants of successful IT investments is the alignment between IT and the competitive strategies of a firm.  Yet it is largely unclear to both researchers and practitioners how to achieve such alignment in the complex business environment.  In this paper, we present and analyze the findings from a case study on how one company uses a well-established strategic management tool, the balanced scorecard, as the framework for aligning its IT initiatives with business strategies. The result is a forward-looking, strategy-oriented corporate culture and financial success for the company.  Based on our findings, we expand the Reich and Benbasat alignment model by adding relationship management as an antecedent of alignment and balanced scorecard as a tool for achieving, managing, and sustaining such alignment.  Managerial and research implications are discussed, as are directions for future research.}

In this study, key elements of Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) are utilized as a means to investigate the effects of virtual organization on academic disciplines. Results of a survey of 471 Business School faculty members, including 63 Information Systems faculty, on the role of virtual organization in academic curricula are analyzed in the terms defined by the AST framework. Results indicate significant variation by discipline, concept area, and appropriation of the concepts related to virtual organization. Implications for Information Science include the need for establishing academic leadership as well as attending to perceived limitations in virtual organization tools and technologies.  In addition, the results have implications for the ongoing dialogue on the role of Information Science and related academic disciplines.}

It identifies five definitions of IT artifact and IT-enabled work system, and then looks in detail at whether the definition of work system mattered in Jasperson, Carter, and Zmud's [2005] article in MIS Quarterly about post-adoptive behaviors.  It argues that their definition perhaps affected their conceptualization of post-adoptive behaviors. It presents an alternative model illustrating how a different definition and greater attention to work system issues might have led to a different conceptualization that addresses different issues.}

Abstract = {Although systems development research is at the core of the Information Systems discipline, some scholars call attention to a teaching and research gap in this area of IS.  In this study, we examine the state of systems development research in IS by analyzing the articles published in three leading journals between 2000 and 2004. We propose a classification framework based on the type of research paradigm (design vs. explanatory) and the nature of the IT-artifact (conceptualization vs. instantiation).  Our results show that about 20% of the articles published in this five year period are focused on systems development. In two of the three journals, there are comparable proportions of studies in the design research and in the explanatory paradigm. However, in all three publications most of the articles are focused on conceptual IT-artifacts, as opposed to algorithms or software-based artifacts. These findings are important for system development researchers when they choose journals where to send their papers.}

The aim of this paper is to organize the literature to provide a clear depiction of what we know and what we don't know about it in order to identify specific areas where future research efforts are needed. A review of the B2C literature of the past seven years yielded 115 papers investigating the phenomenon from the user/customer perspective, 74 of these were empirical. This literature is organized according to the Activity Theory framework, allowing for an enhanced understanding of the phenomenon through a social context perspective. Future research directions are identified and discussed.}

The paper is mainly intended to offer to readers who are unfamiliar with action-research a context where they can become aware of some of the difficulties of its use how they can be solved, and recognize some criteria that can be met to ensure that the results obtained are scientifically valid. The paper concludes by reflecting on the close relationship between action-research and the epis¬temology of the information systems field, suggesting that this relationship should be the object of further exploration.}

Abstract = {Equity across academic disciplines is taken for granted in contemporary business schools. The status of a discipline is crucial for such fairness.  One might assume, therefore, that IS scholars are treated fairly during tenure and promotion processes when compared to scholars from other business school academic fields.  In fact, to the extent that the IS field has short and long term problems, this may not be the case.  The playing field used by business academic disciplines may not be level. This study addresses three questions related to this issue.  The first asks whether there is a level playing field for publication among the various business disciplines, and second, assuming a level playing field, what are the relative productivity differences between dissemination of scientific results among these disciplines?   The third question is how could the playing field be leveled, assuming it is not at the present time. To answer these questions, existing data sources were tapped, one of these containing well over 18,000 data points.  Further, original data was gathered from U.S. business schools, and all the data was analyzed in relation to AACSB data on the relative sizes of business school disciplines.  Given our finding that the playing field is not level, the differences between the IS discipline and the other disciplines - Accounting, Finance, Management, and Marketing - are examined, and the consequences of the disadvantage to the IS discipline are discussed.  The article concludes with recommendations of actions to level the field, and these are presented as a challenge to leaders in the Information Systems discipline.}

The technology-mediated solution influenced by ontological specification was validated through an iterative prototyping form of action research. Users reported that the system was useful in their work, easy to use, and compatible with collaborative work when using it for content analysis in academic research.}

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the level at which a web site addresses privacy has on the users' perceptions and behavioral intentions during the initial interaction with the web site. A research model is presented and empirically tested by means of an experiment. The study showed that web vendors' interventions had an overall effect on the user perceptions of information privacy in the site. However, having more privacy elements in the web site did not increase the favorable perceptions of the web site. The research model also incorporated other privacy related constructs such as general concern about online privacy and type of information.}

Abstract = {The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) forced corporations to examine their spreadsheet use in financial reporting. Corporations do not like what they are seeing. Surveys conducted in response to SOX show that spreadsheets are used widely in corporate financial reporting. Spreadsheet error research, in turn, shows that nearly all large spreadsheets contain multiple errors and that errors of material size are quite common. The first round of Sarbanes-Oxley assessments confirmed concerns about spreadsheet accuracy. Another concern is spreadsheet fraud, which also exists in practice and is easy to perpetrate. Unfortunately, few organizations maintain effective controls to deal with either errors or fraud. This paper examines spreadsheet risks for Sarbanes-Oxley (and other regulations) and discusses how general and IT-specific control frameworks can be used to address the control risks created by spreadsheets.}

Abstract = {Fourth generation wireless systems (4G) are likely to reach the consumer market in another 4-5 years. 4G comes with the promise of increased bandwidth, higher speeds, greater interoperability across communication protocols, and user friendly, innovative, and secure applications. In this article, I list the requirements of the 4G systems by considering the needs of the users in the future. These requirements can be met if technical and business challenges can be overcome. Technical challenges include mobility management, quality of service, interoperability, high data rate, security, survivability, spectrum, intelligent mobile devices, middleware, and network access. I discuss the most plausible solutions to these technical challenges in this paper. Business-related challenges include billing, payment methods, pricing, size of investments, content provision and mediation, and the trade-off between richness and reach. If these technical and business challenges can be met, then 4G will become the next frontier in data and voice communication infrastructure.}

Abstract = {With the wide-spread adoption of Enterprise Systems (ES), such as SAP, Oracle, and Peoplesoft, in medium and large-sized organizations, there is increasing demand for students who know how to work with such systems. While the demand for ES developers and integrators has declined, the demand for employees that can help companies achieve benefits from these systems continues to grow. Such employees need skills in decision-making and process design in an integrated, data-rich environment enabled by an ES. This paper provides advice about teaching with enterprise systems at the undergraduate and graduate levels within the IS curriculum and across management and engineering curricula. This advice is provided by five professors from five different schools, California State University at Chico, Louisiana State University, Queensland University of Technology, Bentley College, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute that together have many years of experience in teaching with SAP or with the Oracle e-business suite. This paper includes a summary of the experiences at each of these schools, advice based on questions from the audience at an AMCIS 2005 panel, and references to resources that may be helpful to those considering, or already engaged in, teaching with enterprise systems.}

Abstract = {Environmental management information systems (EMIS) is defined as 'organizational-technical systems for systematically obtaining, processing, and making available relevant environmental information available in companies'.  Such systems evolved out of a growing need to manage environmental information in response to internal and external pressures such as regulations, consumers, stockholders, and changes in the business environments. While over the past decade EMIS have proliferated in the corporate landscape, these systems have received little attention within the information systems research community as whole. The objective of this paper is to serve as a tutorial providing a conceptual overview of EMIS, highlighting organizational and technical issues, as well as research opportunities.  In this paper we suggest that there are significant and relatively untapped research synergies existing between information systems and environmental management for sustainable development at the organizational and technical levels.}

The data consists of a total of 410 research papers published in ten leading Chinese academic journals related to IS over the five-year period from 1999 to 2004. Compared to IS research abroad, the following may be said of Chinese IS research: (1) Systems-related issues, especially system design issues, system implementation, analytical models and tools, DSS/ESS/EIS are emphasized in research topics, whereas human-related and research methodologies issues are scarce. (2) Empirical studies, including case study, survey and experiment, are few and far between. (3) The majority of non-empirical studies focus on applications and conceptual description of IS, mainly in different applied fields and introducing or illustrating hot topics abroad. The "general shift" from traditional issues such as system design to non-technical problems is still continuing. There is a need to go beyond mere description of IS related phenomenon and to move away from non-empirical to empirical studies.}

Abstract = {The software crisis has been around since 1968 when NATO first identified the problematic nature of software development. In recognition of the need to manage the process of software development many methodologies have been proposed over the years. A recent contribution to this rich set of rigorous software development methodologies is the Software Engineering Institute's (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMi) methodology. While the minimal previous research on CMMi has extolled it, learning how to implement CMMi successfully requires leaning also from its failures. And yet, despite apparent anecdotes, little is known on this topic possibly because of the reluctance of many companies to wash their dirty linen in public.  Based on a set of in-depth interviews accompanied with survey verification, this study examines the assessed effectiveness and efficiency of CMMi as implemented in several projects in a large high tech company in which only low levels of CMMi maturity were reached. In an exploratory manner this study shows the need to differentiate between the quality of the software product developed through CMMi and the quality of the process involved. The study also shows that whether the product is an off the shelf product or a customized one has a direct bearing of the quality of the product developed under CMMi methodology and the process itself. In particular, we discuss why some projects reach only a low maturity level of CMMi even though the organization as a whole might typically reach high maturity levels.}

Abstract = {Several theories of E-Democracy have been presented, and implementations of and experiments 	in E-Democracy emerged. However, existing literature on the subject appears rather non-comprehensive, lacking an integrated basis, for gathering knowledge in the future. After an analysis of theories of E-Democracy versus implementations reported in related literature, we address the need for a model generally absent from contemporary theoretical literature: the Partisan model of E-Democracy. We aim to simplify the current "jungle" of E-Democracy models into four idealised models: the Liberal, the Deliberative, the Partisan, and the Direct. We aim to illustrate how current theories of E-Democracy, in addition to reported implementations, may be covered by these models.  The explanatory potential of these four models is illustrated by analysing implementations of a communication technology for E-Democracy, the web-based discussion forum. We argue that, instead of viewing technology, such as the Internet, as a "black box," any implementation of E-Democracy should be adapted to the specific democracy model(s) pursued by a particular initiative. In addition, E-Democracy researchers could be more specific about their standard of democracy, in order to avoid artificial comparisons or criticisms of contemporary E-Democracy without an explicit framework of criteria. Finally, we discuss the possibilities of unifying the ideals from different models on E-Democracy. We suggest that any context of E-Democracy may in fact require elements from all four models to stay dynamic over time.}

Abstract = {The center of the IS field is presented as a market of ideas, an intellectual exchange related to the design and management of information technologies in organized human enterprise. In this view, the IS field is a loosely coupled system operating through weak social ties across intellectual communities. A loosely coupled system can operate towards contradictory goals of both plasticity and stability in the search for new research opportunities and generation of valid knowledge.  The market of ideas allows reconciliation of rigor and relevance, technical and social, design and explanation.  It lowers the barriers of established disciplinary regimes and institutions, and facilitates scholarship in fields where conditions change quickly. It helps to balance exploration and exploitation in an effort to avoid competency traps.  Limitations of the metaphor are considered.}

Abstract = {Looking at prominent centers of software activity across the globe we observe that software developers tell narratives about themselves to explain their identity and their successes. For example, the USA thinks in terms of the cowboy programmer, Ireland the Celtic Tiger, and Israel the commando programmer.  These narratives provide insights into the mental world of individuals and groups in the global software industry.   This paper collects and documents the narratives of software professionals in six nations:  Russia, Israel, Ireland, USA, India, and Brazil.  The country choice reflects a cross-section of prominent software nations.  Using a taxonomy adapted from the political identity literature, we classify these narratives.  The most frequently occurring narrative is the interplay between redemption, national suffering and heroism.  Brazil, Russia, India, and Israel offer distinct narratives of redemption and suffering. Israel and the USA use distinct narratives of valor.  Among the six nations' narratives, we find that some narratives are collectively oriented while others are individualistically oriented.   National narratives are important for reasons both academic and practical. The literature on comparative human capital focuses on readily measurable data.  Therefore, there may be a gap in understanding global competition in software.  Narratives influence important decisions, such as where to locate a new software R&D site or where to invest in start-ups. An understanding of narratives helps to shape them.}

Abstract = {Numerous studies of global electronic government adoption use the presence or absence of website functions to measure development levels and create rankings. This paper investigates whether these ratings really reflect the overall status of e-government by using a case study of the 89 regional governments in Russia. It provides the results of two waves of evaluating these websites using measures derived from prior e-government studies. These website levels are correlated to available data reflecting the status of e-government in many of these regions. It is concluded that website levels are only loosely coupled to the overall state of e-government in these regions. It is therefore hazardous to draw too many conclusions about the development of e-government in various countries using relative rankings that are only based on websites. As a case study, this paper illustrates what can and cannot be done when highly limited data are available.}

Abstract = {The Internet-enabled connectivity has created opportunities for businesses to conduct various forms of collaborative activities. However, the findings of several surveys indicate that the deficiencies in data quality might compromise the potential benefits of joint efforts. Global data synchronization (GDS), the process of timely updating product data to maintain the data consistency among business partners, is viewed as the key to materialize the benefits of e-collaboration in the global supply chain setting. In the paper, we present the need for data synchronization, discuss the evolution of technical standards of data identification schemes, and introduce the Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN), the platform on which global data synchronization is substantiated. We detail the structure of GDSN and the protocols for the process of GDS. Furthermore, we discuss business and management implications of GDS, different approaches to implementing GDS, and challenges to the implementation of GDS. The emergence of GDS and GDSN presents research opportunities on issues relating to the implementation of GDS, the relationship between GDSN and EPCglobal Network, the impact of GDS on inter-organizational relationships, the network effect of global standards, and evolution of complementary standards. We discuss these research opportunities. In brief, the article covers the history, present status, and future of GDS and GDSN, as well as their potentials, benefits, and implementation issues.}

In this paper, we extend previous instrument development research to develop and test a process-oriented thermometer of IT business value using survey data based on executives' perceptions of IT impacts at multiple points along the value chain. Consistent with earlier research, we find that our process measures are sensitive to differences in industry, firm size, and business strategy. Through additional analysis of post-implementation reviews of IT impacts in four firms, we find consistency of within-firm perceptual measures among teams of senior executives, highlighting the potential for our thermometer to gauge the level of IT impacts within a single firm. We conclude that process-oriented perceptual measures can offer new and useful insights into IT impacts, complementing what we already know from firm-level objective metrics.}

Abstract = {User acceptance issues and user-centered design have long been an important theme in information systems research. In the field of health care information systems, much attention has been devoted to user issues in the health care provider domain, e.g. physicians, nurses, medical records. Recent developments toward promoting more consumer-oriented healthcare information systems have opened new questions about how individuals can and should relate to their personal health information in the form of Personal Health Records (PHR) systems. This paper adopts a user-driven perspective toward these new and challenging questions. Drawing upon ideas and discussions from a cross-section of information systems researchers, health care providers, private industry, and government, we examine several of the major issues that will need to be addressed in order to meet a national challenge to adopt PHR for all Americans by 2014.}

Abstract = {The use of research models in driving scholarly investigation is of great importance in any field, including information systems (IS).  As such, a taxonomy of IS research models should be of substantial value to the discipline.  Such a taxonomy is developed in this article based on the IS research literature.  Eleven model types are examined in detail in order to investigate how they are used by researchers, in articles published in seven leading IS journals during a recent six year period.  Interesting results emerge in the use of models overall, as well as trends over time and relationships with specific methodologies and IS journals.  Multi-tier influence diagram is the most used research model in IS research, while the no model, listing of variables, mathematical model, and simple influence diagram also find significant usage among the IS research community.  Patterns of model use were also identified based on top journals and prevalent research methodologies.}

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of creeping authoritarianism by the Putin administration, this paper examines whether or not Russian efforts to enact e-government are enhancing, inhibiting, or neutral towards the establishment of preconditions for democracy in Russia. Eighty official regional governmental websites in 2003 and 85 in 2004 are examined to benchmark their contents according to a set of measures related to Information, Communications / Participation, Action / Transaction, and Integration.  This paper also considers the contributions of the Electronic Russia (E-Russia) program launched in 2002 as a nine-year, $2.57B effort to bring e-government to Russia. It is concluded that the main thrust of the websites was on the Information category, with some increases in the Communications / Participation from 2003 to 2004. Almost no services were enacted. Using a detailed analysis of the E-Russia expenditures, it is concluded that this program was focused more on building infrastructure than on building up e-government websites or increasing Internet access. Most support is found for the proposition that Russian e-government efforts so far have done little to enhance the preconditions for democracy, but at the same time should not be viewed as a "Potemkin village," i.e. as a means to conceal moves away from democracy.}

Abstract = {As motivations of Information Technology (IT) outsourcing are evolving from a primary focus on cost reduction to an emerging emphasis on improving business performance, it is imperative for organizations to align their outsourcing strategy with their business strategy in order to reap better outsourcing benefits and firm performance. Accordingly, a critical challenge facing organizations is how to effectively organize and manage a well-planned outsourcing strategy in accordance with the direction of a business strategy. With the premise that organizations with the fit between business strategy (i.e., defenders, prospectors, and analyzers) and outsourcing strategy (i.e., independent, arm's length, and embedded strategies) are expected to have better outsourcing benefits and organizational performance than those without such fit, this study seeks to answer the following questions: First, are certain outsourcing strategies more effective than others in particular business strategies?; Second, do their effective alignments positively affect outsourcing benefits and firm performance? To answer these questions, we hypothesize three theoretical feasible sets of internally congruent patterns between business strategy and outsourcing strategy which lead to a greater achievement of outsourcing benefits and firm performance as compared with misfit patterns between them. Empirical data gathered from 136 organizations in Korea that have outsourced their IT functions to external service providers are analyzed. The empirical evidence shows that outsourcing alignment with business strategy significantly influences the outsourcing success and firm performance of defenders, analyzers, and prospectors. The findings have significant implications for further research and practice.}

Abstract = {Findings in an IT workforce study support the emphasis of business content espoused by IS curriculum guidelines.  Business domain and project management skills are critical to keep in house while technical skills were cited as the top skills sourced.  Paradoxically, technical skills are those cited for entry-level positions. We discuss the issues raised by these findings and recommend several approaches for IS programs to consider.  IS programs must offer a functionally integrated curriculum and deliver it in an experiential business context.  We provide several examples of innovative pedagogical approaches and industry alliances which demonstrate mechanisms to provide students with a stronger business orientation in applying IT.  We recommend a more proactive approach to enrollment including better promotion of IS programs.}

Abstract = {An academic course presents an opportunity for all participants to collaborate for improving their knowledge.  This collective improvement of knowledge is typically documented via material provided by the instructor and notes and assignments prepared by students.  Over the course of a semester, these materials provide not only the collective knowledge in that course, but also provide a chronological history of how the knowledge base evolved. The focus of this study is wiki collaboration in teaching & learning contexts.   A wiki is a medium in which a group of individuals can work together asynchronously on an idea and easily capture the essence in a reusable format.  Technically, a wiki is a collection of hyperlinked Web pages that are assembled with wiki software.   With wikis, the line between reader and contributor is intentionally blurred.  Further, wiki use reflects the view of an instructor as one who facilitates information sharing among learners rather than simply transmitting knowledge from themselves to their students.    Our initial motivation to explore the usefulness of wikis for teaching and learning was driven by the fact that wikis provide a medium in which several individuals could asynchronously work together on an idea and easily capture the essence in a reusable format.   We found that: (1) Wikis can be can be used for a variety of tasks ranging from signup sheet for students to self organize, to undertaking business analyses, to analyzing policy positions; (2) Instructor support and facilitation is key; and (3) Ease-of-use issues are present but do not preclude success.}

Abstract = {E-learning has considerable financial, social and organisational advantages. However, e-learning use among professional workplaces remains limited comparing to traditional methods. This raises the problem of factors influencing the adoption of e-learning among human resource management practices. This paper tries to identify and test determinants of e-learning use by workers. Technology adoption theories developed in information system researches offer a conceptual framework to apprehend key factors that influence workers' intention to use e-learning. Empirical study conducted on 350 Tunisian employees suggests the importance of their perceptions of usefulness, ease of use and computer self-efficacy judgments as key determinants of e-learning acceptance. Theoretical and Managerial implications for researchers and human resource managers are derived from the results of this research.}

Abstract = {Agile methodologies are changing the way we develop software.  Their emphasis on team-oriented development, joint code ownership, and reliance on people rather than predefined processes to guide activities, is transforming software development into a socio-technical process.  As methodologies become increasingly more people and team-oriented, there is an urgent need to investigate the personality profiles of software developers and their likely impact on the productivity of the development team.  A review of the IS research literature on personality studies found Jungian typology operationalized as Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to be the most popular approach for assessing personality profiles.  We compared the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality, which is currently gaining popularity among personality psychologists, with MBTI.  Our analysis, based on extant research literature in personality psychology and group behavior, suggests that FFM not only provides better measures for all factors that are measured by MBTI, but it also allows us to assess Neuroticism, an important personality trait that is of interest to researchers studying work groups, such as the agile development team.  Our finding has important implications for researchers studying the agile development process.  It is also highly relevant to studies investigating the personality profiles of IS professionals.  Thus, our study attempts to bring in fresh insights from Personality Psychology, our reference discipline, to enrich IS research.}

Abstract = {Because business-to-business (B2B) electronic marketplaces (e-marketplaces) facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers, they strive to foster a trustworthy trading environment with a variety of trust-building measures. However, little research has been undertaken to explore trust-building measures used in B2B e-marketplaces, or to determine to what extent these measures are applied in B2B e-marketplaces and how they are applied. Based on reviews of the scholarly, trade, and professional literature on trust in electronic commerce, we identified 11 trust-building measures used to create trust in B2B e-marketplaces. Zucker's trust production theory [1986] was applied to understand how these trust-building measures will enhance participants' trust in buyers and sellers in B2B e-marketplaces or in B2B e-marketplace providers. A descriptive content analysis of 100 B2B e-marketplaces was conducted to survey the current usage of the 11 trust-building measures. Many of the trust-building measures were found to be widely used in the B2B e-marketplaces. However, although they were proven to be effective in building trust-related beliefs in online business environments, several institutional-based trust-building measures, such as escrow services, insurance and third-party assurance seals, are not widely used in B2B e-marketplaces.}

Abstract = {Deception in applicant résumés is a major business problem. With the rapid growth of Internet job websites and computer-mediated communication, organizations are more at risk than ever before. Researchers have tried to improve individuals' deception detection accuracy to minimize the impact of deception, including warning individuals about deception and training individuals to detect deception. However, evidence was found that trained and warned individuals might make more incorrect judgments about true information, which are known as false alarms.  Further, few previous studies focused on the computer-mediated settings that are now a central part of business communication.  After conducting an experiment to understand these and other causes of false alarms in computer-mediated interview settings, we found that individuals performing interviews over an audio-based communication channel incorrectly judged interviewees as being deceptive more often than did individuals performing interviews via e-mail.  We found that while the number of lies detected was low for both types of communication, individuals communicating over an audio-based channel had more false alarms.  We also found that the combination of in-advance training and a just-in-time warning did not affect receivers' judgments about deception in our computer-mediated interview setting.}

Abstract = {Various e-learning systems have been developed and implemented in educational contexts. However, few studies try to go beyond the experimental level of identifying numerous factors that influence this technology and apply them to a real academic class of students. This article based on an in-depth analysis of a business school case--Montpellier Business School (France)--and survey data from 405 students assessed on their use of the e-learning platform, helps illuminate the patterns involved in e-learning performance. A literature review on e-learning performance factors is realized and a theoretical model focusing on three dimensions of e-learning performance--the learner side, the institutional environment and the e-learning system per se--is presented and tested empirically. The key findings of this paper identify motivation and self-discipline of students as main drivers of e-learning outcomes. Other results show that the integration of e-learning in a pedagogical program requires the analysis of its performance not only from learners and instructors point of view, but also from the underlying strategic perspective of the institution.}

Abstract = {You're reading an abstract of a research paper.  Is the abstract sufficiently relevant to make you want to read the whole paper? That's the question that we look at here.  We start with an assumption: If the abstract doesn't grab your attention, you will skip the paper and go on to read another.  To find out if our assumption is true, we asked two groups of people (a group of information systems professionals and a group that conducts research on information systems) to judge whether abstracts would entice them to read the article.   Unfortunately, we found little consensus in the literature about how best to measure the relevance of a paper or its abstract.  We therefore ran an experiment to improve our understanding. In this experiment we used three dimensions of relevance based on the work of Benbasat and Zmud (1999):  Important: the topic is important to the reader,  Accessible: the paper is written so that its ideas can be understood, and   Applicable: the reader can apply the paper his or her own work. Our question was: Do people use these dimensions to determine from the abstract whether or not the article is relevant enough for them to read all of it?  We created, validated, and ran a questionnaire to measure these three dimensions. We found that, for both practitioner and academic audiences, being important, accessible, and applicable are indeed significant indicators for reading an article based on its abstract.

Abstract = {Virtual communities provide an attractive place for organizations to mine information regarding customer perceptions, needs, and demographics; as well as to generate revenue through sales of products, services, information, and advertising. However, the community conversation provides information about only one type of community user, the poster. Information about the lurker, who never posts, is conspicuously absent from the obvious community data source, the postings. Lurkers may be a large portion of the user community and could provide key revenue sources and vital information, or they potentially could turn into posters.   This research contrasts the differences in the underlying motivations of lurkers, infrequent posters, and posters in order to understand the resulting differences in their behavior. 518 users from 20 virtual communities were categorized into three groups based upon their posting behaviors: lurkers who never posted, infrequent posters who posted three or less times per month, and frequent posters. Results revealed that lurkers differed significantly from posters, especially in their willingness to give information and exchange social support. There was a gradual progression from lurker to poster regarding the desires to get knowledge and obtain shopping information. Implications about a possible psychological barrier regarding giving information and social support are discussed.}

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed many organizations switching from function-oriented to customer-centric in their information systems applications designs. This paradigm shift has attracted growing attention among researchers in better understanding the design process of customer-centric IS applications; an area that has not been investigated adequately so far. This paper examines the processes of gathering and segmenting customer-centric attributes during the design stage of an IS application development by analyzing data extracted from a successful case of developing an online property auction site. The findings reveal that gathering and segmenting customer-centric attributes during the design stage of a customer-centric IS application development encompass four phases: (1) Identify customer requirements; (2) Structure customer requirements; (3) Link customer requirements to system design attributes; and (4) Review the level of customer satisfaction with the new system. We discuss the implications of our findings for both research and practice.}

Abstract = {Research pertaining to emergency response systems has accelerated over the past few years, particularly since 9/11 events, and more recently due to Hurricane Katrina and concern of the avian flu pandemic.  This study examines the requirements that are the most demanding with respect to software and hardware, and the associated design strategies for a public health emergency response system (ERS) for electronic laboratory diagnostics consultation.  In addition, this study illustrates ways to evaluate the design decisions. An important goal of a public health ERS is to improve the communication and notification of life-threatening diseases and harmful agents. The system under study is called Secure Telecommunications Application Terminal Package or STATPack. STATPack supports distributed laboratories to communicate information and make decisions regarding biosecurity situations. The intent of the system is to help hospital laboratories enhance their preparedness for a bioterrorism event or other public health emergency. The practical nature of this research concerns how an ERS diagnostic and consultation system was designed to alert and support first responders and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The academic nature of the research centers on the critical requirements of an ERS and how these unique needs can be met through careful design.  Understanding the critical requirements will assist developers to better meet the expectations of the users. Specifically, I conducted a thirteen month study analyzing the requirements, design, and implementation of the system.}

Abstract = {Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act addresses the effectiveness of internal controls, which in most organizations are either fully or partially automated due to the pervasiveness and ubiquity of information technologies. Significant or material control deficiencies have to be reported publicly.  The adverse impact on organizations declaring deficiencies can be severe, for example, damage to reputation and/or market value. While there are many practitioner-led manuals and methods for dealing with 404, there has been little published in the academic research literature investigating the role of Information Systems organizations in implementing Section 404.  The paper addresses this gap in knowledge.  We used institutional theory as the lens through which to examine the experiences of Section 404 implementation in three global organizations.  We used the case study method and an abductive strategy to gather and analyze data respectively. Our findings are summarized in six recommendations.  We found that institutional pressures play a critical role in the implementation of Section 404.  In particular, organizations face coercive pressure to achieve Section 404 compliance, without which punitive sanctions can be imposed by regulators.  Organizations tend to imitate one another in the methods they use so that each is perceived to be in line with their competitive environment.  Organizations face normative pressures to act in ways that are socially acceptable, which is to achieve compliance.  Failure to do so would be a signal to the market that the organization does not take controls seriously.  We expand these findings in terms of power and influence tactics that IS organizations can use when implementing Section 404.  Our findings provide directions for practice and lines of enquiry for further research.}

Abstract = {Design forms one critical paradigmatic view that pervades organizational studies, management, and information systems research. Building on the discussions in the first Working Conference on Designing Information and Organizations with a Positive Lens, we chart the potential contribution of positive design to the shaping of organizations, work processes, artifacts, communication networks, and information technologies. The figure of speech "Design with a Positive Lens," or in short "Positive Design," connotes here a distinctive perspective on design that is less focused on the detection of errors associated with gaining control and more concerned with human-centered design associated with the shaping of hopeful organizations and a thriving future. The paper examines how positive design can contribute to the design of information systems and organizations as related to five broad-scale areas: design of high performance work processes; positive design methods and techniques; cooperation and collaboration across boundaries to promote positive change; positive organizational design; and design science and practice. In this paper we aspire to promote the emerging cross-disciplinary discourse between scholars and designers that will foster positive organizational and technological design.}

Abstract = {AOL's recent public release of user search information resulted in a heated privacy debate. This case study is a detailed account of this incident. The case is designed as an in-class teaching aid covering managerial, legal, and ethical issues related to privacy. It consists of four sections (A, B, C, and D). Each section is fairly short and is designed to be read in class, separated by discussion of the previous section. Alternatively, the first section might be distributed in advance; though this runs the risk of students identifying the case and jumping ahead in the discussion (AOL's identity is concealed from students until the end of section B). A set of potential discussion questions for each section appears in the appendix. While there are too many questions to be covered in a single class, instructors can choose questions based on their particular teaching objective. A teaching note is also available from the authors.}

Abstract = {Delivery of healthcare services presents many challenges for governments in most developing countries. Some of these challenges include financial and human resources issues that might affect governments' ability to manage and transform scarce resources to meet healthcare needs. Telemedicine, a healthcare delivery technology where physicians examine patients from distant locations using information technologies, is reported to be increasingly helpful in meeting the needs of the healthcare sector in developing nations such as those in sub-Saharan Africa. This conceptual study reports on the sectoral adoption of telemedicine in Ethiopia, a sub-Saharan African country. We examine the potential benefits of telemedicine diffusion in Ethiopia, addressing the country's healthcare needs, and discussing the obstacles and challenges. Based on previous literature, as well as experiences drawn from other developing nations, we address three potential factors that could influence the diffusion of telemedicine in Ethiopia: active participation of institutions of higher education, Ethiopian foreign alliances, and government involvement. Although the initial successes are relatively small and involve isolated projects, they have been promising and have set the stage for researchers to investigate prevailing projects so as to gain better understanding of the aforementioned factors. Our study does not claim that telemedicine can solve all of Ethiopia's medical challenges; however, we contend that it is a starting point to reach Africans that live in areas with limited medical facilities and personnel. Hence, our study could have far reaching implications as the world looks to help this country, and by extension, other developing countries, to overcome their medical challenges and join the information society.}

Abstract = {Physicians face an increasing variety of options for using information systems in the course of delivering and managing medical care. Although the technical capabilities of medical information systems are expanding rapidly, such systems cannot be expected to be truly effective unless they mesh with the broader work system that includes the physician's work place and work routines. This research focuses on physicians' intent for continued use of an online medical evaluation system as an indicator of the mesh between an information technology and medical work environments, and it draws contextual elements from technology acceptance and compatibility models to help explain the intent for continued use. Ninety-seven physicians throughout the U.S. participated in an extensive survey that provided a basis for analysis, and results showed general support for the acceptance model used in the study. The theoretical and managerial implications of the study center on the importance of understanding continued use of medical information systems with the help of work practice compatibility and acceptance models as they apply to the demanding environment of medical practice.}

Abstract = {There is a growing recognition among alignment researchers and IT professionals that "one size does not fit all."  In this article, we provide an important extension of alignment research that shows three profiles linking IT to different business objectives.  We address the need to identify the appropriate types of IT alignment by using a multi-method study including interviews and cases.  Two dimensions define the three alignment profiles: internal IT-business integration and external market engagement.  The technical resource profile calls for low levels of IT-business integration and IT-market engagement.  The business enabler profile deploys IT in some business processes and begins engaging IT with customers and suppliers.  The strategic weapon profile uses IT to mobilize and extend the enterprise, which requires extensive IT deployment, both internally and externally.  Each profile differs in strategies, criteria, capabilities, and mental models.  Importantly, IT decision-makers should not adopt stage-model thinking which assumes that technical resource profiles naturally progress up the chain.  Rather, successful use of IT requires specifying the requisite alignment profile as an initial design decision so that appropriate levels of resource allocation and management involvement occur.}

Abstract = {This study employs 130 health care integrated delivery systems (IDSs) currently active in the U.S. to examine the quality and financial performance impacts of strategic fit for interorganizational networks.  Using secondary data from HIMSS Analytics and the American Hospital Directory, this study classifies the IDSs into High-Maturity Organizations and Low-Maturity Organizations based on the corresponding levels of IT integration and organizational maturity achieved at the time of the study.  A model of the relationship between strategic fit and both average length of hospital stay and operational cost is then tested for each group.  With comparisons across the two levels of IDS development, the results suggest that IDSs that have achieved both high IT integration and organizational maturity exhibit greater improvements to both average length of hospital stay and operational cost than do IDSs at a lower level of IT integration and organizational maturity.}

Abstract = {Most research on structuration or the appropriation of ICT in organizations has put aside the problem of dyschronies. It has not taken into account the differences in nature, speed, and temporality of changes that co-exist within an organization. To address this limitation, the author of this paper suggests a model based on the theory of practice and neo-institutionalist perspectives, so as to make sense of the co-evolution of intra-organizational fields. This model, which proposes a balance between various institutional tensions, has been worked out inductively from a longitudinal case study on communication fields within the Roman Curia, the administrative headquarters of the Catholic Church located in the Vatican. These tensions are related to socio-technical, socio-theological, socio-organizational, and socio-economic areas. A set of propositions regarding the link between intra-organizational fields and tensions and the relationships between intra-organizational fields (parallel, convergent, and competing evolutions) is proposed.}

Abstract = {The content published on the Web never stops growing. It is becoming essential to efficiently manage it. Organizations are increasingly searching for more efficient and feasible ways in which to manage the content of their websites. Content Management Systems offer a solution by facilitating the creation of websites and providing content management. Many organizations are now using Management Content Systems. This increasing interest is apparent in the growing market of such systems and in the updates of existing systems.  For an organization, the choice of a Content Management System is not easy, since this is a dynamic market shared among many different publishers. The offer evaluation process requires specific tools. In order to help these organizations in their choice, we have attempted to provide an analysis framework for these applications. This analysis framework designed to help organizations choose their application contributes to the evaluation of these applications. This article puts forward a Content Management software analysis framework and explains its application to a sample of 23 products. The size of this sample allows us to asses the strategic grouping of Content Management Systems. Effectively, the analysis results in the identification of two strategic groups whose main differences lay in the software characteristics and their target markets.}

UTAUT integrates eight theories of individual acceptance into one comprehensive model designed to assist in understanding what factors either enable or hinder technology adoption and use. As such, it provides a useful lens through which to view what is currently taking place in the healthcare industry regarding EMR adoption. This is mutually beneficial to both the healthcare and MIS communities, as UTAUT offers valuable practical insight to the healthcare industry in explaining why EMR technology has not been more widely adopted as well as what prescriptions may facilitate future adoption, while offering the MIS community the opportunity to strengthen existing theory through an illustration of its application.}

Anchored on human capital theory and previous literature, we build a comprehensive model to estimate the value of various IT certifications in terms of their contributions to IT professionals' wages.  We estimate our model using third-party survey data.  The three main findings from the study are: 1) IT certifications are valuable in general; 2) there is a substitution effect between IT certifications and education and between IT certifications and experience; and 3) the value of IT certifications are job and industry specific. In addition, we estimate wage premiums of various IT certifications in the study.  From these findings, we draw managerial implications for current and future IT professionals, IT managers, and human resource managers.}

Abstract = {In this study we examine the influence of premier information systems research over time to assess the maturity of the Information Systems (IS) field and its impact on subsequent IS and non-IS research. 19,357 citations from the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) (1982-2004) are attributed to 879 articles published in MIS Quarterly (MISQ), Information Systems Research (ISR), and the IS articles from Management Science (MS) between 1982 and 2004, and this number continues to increase over time. The results suggest that research in premier IS journals has an influence on other disciplines as 7,137 citations come from outside the IS discipline and this number continues to increase over time. Of particular note is the consistent increase over time in citations of premier IS research articles from the management, engineering and physical sciences, organizational behavior, and computer science disciplines. Given recent debates regarding the IT artifact, we also directly test the impact of articles that address the IT artifact and those that do not. We find that articles that directly address the IT artifact are cited significantly more often than those that do not, consistent with arguments made by Benbasat et al. [2003].}

Abstract = {South Africa has one of the most sophisticated information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures in Africa, and was one of the early adopters of the Internet on the continent. This paper describes a longitudinal analysis of Internet diffusion in South Africa over the period 1994 to 2004 by making use of the Global Diffusion of the Internet (GDI) framework. It also analyses the determinants of further diffusion. The analysis shows that in 2004, at the end of its first decade of democracy, less than 10 percent of the population accessed the Internet despite its relatively wide geographic dispersion. Across the education, commercial, health, and public sectors the Internet had been largely embraced, with potential for further diffusion. The underlying national Internet connectivity infrastructure was well established. Strong competition existed between Internet service providers despite a monopoly on fixed-line telecommunications provision for much of the period. The Internet was being used for sophisticated applications in several sectors. The overall analysis reflected South Africa's reputation as having one of the most developed ICT sectors in Africa. The findings are perhaps also a reflection of its status as a middle-income developing country. After major growth in the 1990s, from 2000 to 2004 growth declined significantly. Reasons identified included the monopoly telecommunications environment over much of the period, restrictive regulation, delayed implementation of policies, and the socio-economic divide in the nation. Telecommunications policy directives announced at the end of 2004 helped in reversing the trend of stagnation that had set in.}

Special issues of MISQ in 2004 and Information Technology and People in 2001 called attention both to action research and research methodology. Yet action research is not widely disseminated across the information systems discipline.  The purpose of this tutorial is to advance information systems action research and serve researchers, practitioners, and reviewers by addressing the dissemination problem. We consider how an action research project and the resulting article can widen its appeal to information systems scholars in two ways. First, by clarifying the information systems research paradigm vocabulary of epistemology, methodology, and the action research approach. And second, we outline an article structure more familiar to positivist researchers, thereby creating a bridge among IS scholars to a largely positivist audience. This tutorial is based on the experiences of the authors as information systems action researchers.}

This analysis is then merged with an overview of French and American case studies. The results demonstrate strong differences in the OV production systems, as well as in organizational behaviour's reaction to cross-organizational discourse.}

Abstract = {In the age of life-long learning and increased competition for time, motivation becomes a salient issue. Students need to be more intrinsically motivated in the absence of more formal structure. This is especially true in online learning environments where direct instructor influence is mitigated. Online learning environments typically embrace many choices in ways in which learning material is presented and interaction with students is supported in both individual and collaborative contexts. As such, it is imperative that we better understand the implications of various learning activities and associated technologies on aspects of intrinsic motivation in e-learning. In this paper we examine these effects through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with students in an online MBA program. Results encourage use of a pedagogically driven portfolio of learning activities supported by well-selected and integrated audio, video, and data technologies. Extension to use of mobile devices in ubiquitous e-learning contexts is explored.}

The average growth levels of Internet users for 1995 and 2003 are calculated and the associations between Internet growth level and several types of factors such as econ¬omic, educational, institutional, infrastructural, innovation-related, and environmental factors are examined. Human development, higher education, technology availability, and computer growth levels explain more than 84 percent of the variance in African Internet growth levels. When compared to non-African nations, Africa lacks the influence of institutional variables. Compared with a set of economically similar developing nations (bas¬ed on similar GDP per capita and income inequality levels), Africa has different Internet growth levels, even though the number of Internet hosts per 1,000 and delays in starting Internet diffusion are similar. These differences are probably due to lack of education, human development, infrastructural and environmental variables.}

Abstract = {Enterprise systems (ES) are industry-specific, customizable software packages that integrate information and business process in organizations. Despite the advantages associated with implementing ES, their success has been mixed. This has attracted the interest of researchers and resulted in a proliferation of literature on implementation. However, the extant ES studies lack a theoretical framework for the examination of ES use and its implications for change in organizations. We seek to bridge this research gap by proposing a theoretical framework for change induced through ES use. This paper contributes to theory in two areas. First, by analytically separating the notions of structure, institution, and organization, we illustrate a consistent application of Giddens' structuration theory to ES use. Second, we develop a structurational model of ES-induced change that explicates the relationship between specific characteristics of ES and the nature of change occasioned through their use by human agents within a historically shaped organizational context. Towards this objective, we distinguish ES from other information systems. Implications for practitioners and researchers are presented.}

Abstract = {Defining the central identity of the information systems (IS) field is a subject of ongoing concern and debate among IS researchers. Published empirical studies to date have focused on restricted sets of IS-related journal publications spread across relatively short time periods. This paper offers a broader review of the central identity of the IS field, using three dimensions proposed by Albert and Whetten [1985]: central character (i.e., what topics do IS scholars research?); temporal continuity (i.e., to what extent has the identity of the IS field remained static over time?); and distinctiveness (i.e., how unique is research published in IS vs. non-IS research journals?). The first two dimensions are examined using a dataset containing 6,466 journal citations drawn from seven leading IS journals over a 32-year period, and the third is evaluated by comparing results from these seven journals with research published in 15 leading non-IS business journals over the same time period. Results suggest that articles published in leading IS journals do share a strong central character that is distinct from research published in non-IS journals, and yet an identity that has continually shifted over time. This study contributes to the literature by providing an empirically supported review of who we are, how we are different, and some thoughts about where we may be going as a discipline.}

Abstract = {The UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology), a unified model of the acceptance of technology by workers in the United States, explains individual acceptance and usage decisions of a technology in organizations (R2 up to 70 percent); its usefulness, however, has not been tested in settings outside the U.S. Other models of technology use, such as the Technology Acceptance Model, have been predictive within the U.S., but have been found to be less predictive when tested in countries outside the U.S., such as Switzerland, Japan, Arabic countries, and Hong Kong, suggesting that culture may play a significant role in Information Technology (IT) usage and adoption. No clear relationships, however, have been established between cultural variables and IT adoption factors. The UTAUT model includes social influence as a factor that explains some of the variance in users' acceptance of technology. One dimension of the social influence factor is culture. This study examines the effect of culture through the social influence variable of the UTAUT model on user acceptance of Prepayment Metering Systems - an Information Technology-based innovation in India. The findings indicate that social influence, along with performance expectancy and effort expectancy (R2 = 72 percent), is a significant factor influencing consumers' intention to use the Prepayment Metering Systems. Social influence represents societal pressure on users to engage in a certain behavior. This social pressure for an individual to perform a behavior varies by culture. Our study confirms our proposition that the social influence based in culture will provide additional explanatory power concerning consumers' intention to use a technology.}

Abstract = {There is much debate about social responsibility in the context of business and industry but not much in the context of information technology. We address this void by examining developments and innovations at the interface between information technologies and positive social change. In particular, the paper explores the role of information technology in three critical domains: connectivity, education, and economic development. The underlying premise of the authors is that information and communication technologies can serve agents of social innovation in underserved communities and that their consideration is vital to the success of many efforts that pursue global and sustainable change. We also submit that such issues ought to be integrated more centrally into the practice and scholarly mission of the IS discipline.}

Abstract = {Over the years, interpretivism has been gradually gaining ground in Information Systems (IS) research.   At the heart of this interpretivist movement (which has helped to advance its cause) is a belief in theoretical and methodological pluralism.  Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is to reflect on how interpretive IS researchers can move beyond theoretical and methodological pluralism to leverage the inherent strengths of the interpretivist paradigm.  In this regard, we note that there has been little discussion in IS literature about how interpretive researchers can actively seek to purposefully leverage the respective strengths of the informing theoretical perspective and the chosen strategy of inquiry throughout the research process while being fully cognizant of the ensuing criteria for ensuring trustworthiness of the study.   To illustrate the importance of achieving such leverage in interpretive IS research, we use the example of the ethnographic approach being informed by symbolic interactionism.   At the same time, we explicate how the analytical edge of the constant comparative technique from grounded theory can enhance this leverage.  We contend that this paper's contribution has value as it provides a starting point for interested researchers to apply this approach to other combinations of theoretical perspectives and strategies of inquiry.}

Abstract = {One of the main challenges of exchanging patient care records between heterogeneous systems is the difficulty in overcoming semantic differences between them. This is further exacerbated by the lack of standardization in messaging protocols. As a solution to this problem, multiple ideas and standards have been proposed for exchanging clinical and administrative data in the healthcare area. However, most of these methods place some restrictions on the platform, standard or format, of the data. This paper proposes a context-specific, mediating schema-based architecture that enhances the transfer of electronic patient care records between healthcare information systems by using a reusable and portable model. The main contribution of this approach is its adaptability to a variety of schemas for the source and target systems.}

Abstract = {As information technology has evolved and branched into Electronic Medical Records (EMR), the adoption of EMRs in healthcare has yet to permeate even half of hospitals. One factor in this lack of adoption is an insufficient supply of knowledgeable information technology professionals in the healthcare environment. To help resolve this shortage of professionals, an undergraduate degree to address technology, operations, and healthcare is proposed. This program builds on existing coursework in a state university to provide undergraduate students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to assist in the adoption, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of EMRs in the healthcare environment.}

Abstract = {This paper details the development of a Masters in Health Informatics (MHI) program. It traces the design from conception through environmental scanning and curriculum development and into survey validation. One of the underlying characteristics identified in the analysis of other programs was that there seemed to be two subgroups or themes in health informatics programs: clinical and health administrative foci. A draft curriculum addressing the interest of both subgroups was developed, and a focus group of local health care industry professionals was conducted. The draft curriculum was the basis for surveys targeting the two potential subgroups. In addition to validating the interest in a masters program from both groups, the data was analyzed for potential differences between the two groups. These results confirmed the initial premise that a well-designed health informatics curriculum must address both the clinical and healthcare administration subgroups.}

Our study contributes by examining relationships between managers' leadership behavior and user technology beliefs. Drawing on the transformational leadership theory [Bass 1985], we develop a research model comparing the effect of leadership behaviors of two managerial roles - project champions and direct managers - on user technology beliefs. Our cross-sectional survey across 138 users in five organizations suggests that project champions and direct managers' leadership behaviors exercise different influences on users' technology beliefs. Implications of this study on research and practice are discussed.}

Abstract = {This article inductively examines the question of the IS field's core. We argue that as a socially constructed field, the core aspects of IS can be identified from the work conducted and published by members of IS community. The abstracts (including titles) of 1,197 IS studies in three premier IS journals for the past 26 years were examined to identify the core of the field and explore its evolving nature with help of a neural network software as the analysis tool. The field, contextual, transitory, and evolving core of IS are identified through the analysis of 267,034 words in the knowledge base constructed. The results show both stability and evolution of the core of IS field. The three journals examined show sufficient commonality on core of the field, with slightly different preferences for research topics and methods. Given the diverse nature of the IS field, we believe that such a retrospective and descriptive study can document evidence of the "core" and facilitate a better understanding of the evolution of the field.}

Abstract = {Healthcare processes are frequently fragmented and often badly supported with IT. Inter- and intra-organizational communication and media frictions complicate the continuous provision of information according to the principle of information logistics. Based on extensive literature review, we present the vision of seamless healthcare with horizontally and vertically integrated healthcare processes enabled by seamless IT support. Its implementation requires the establishment of a communication infrastructure and the deployment of adequate standards in healthcare. There are already comprehensive approaches for dealing with integrating heterogeneous information systems. However, they lack a common communication infrastructure and do not support proactivity and flexibility which are dominant characteristics in healthcare. We propose a software agent-based approach for realizing the vision of seamless healthcare. We present a corresponding implementation for integrating heterogeneous information systems in the context of the German Health Telematics Infrastructure. Based on the concept and the implementation, we show that the modular approach is capable of supporting a wide range of different applications. We furthermore outline which facets of an agent-based solution could be implemented in an operative real-world environment. In closing we derive implications for IT decision makers in healthcare and show directions for future approaches for reducing information logistics related deficits in healthcare.}

Abstract = {Research productivity is one means by which academic units attain legitimacy within their institutional milieu and make their case for resources.  Journal quality assessment is an important component for assessing faculty research productivity.  We introduce the Author Affiliation Index (AAI), a simple method for assessing journal quality, to the IS domain. Essentially, the AAI of a journal is the percentage of academic authors publishing in that journal who are affiliated with a base set of high-quality academic institutions. Besides explaining the AAI, we demonstrate its use with a set of well-known IS journals, discuss its rankings vis-à-vis those resulting from other methods, and provide an example of how the basic AAI approach can be modified by changing the base school set that is used to define journal quality.  The AAI has a number of advantages.  First, it is a simple, low cost and transparent method for assessing any journal given a base school set.  Second, it provides a consistent ranking of journals, particularly of those beyond the top consensus journals where less consistency is achieved with other measures.  Third, it enables new journals to be rapidly assessed against more established ones without the lags or costs of other measures.  The AAI provides another indicator of journal quality that is different from surveys and citation analyses.}

The goal of the paper is to describe how an appropriately designed and evidence-based CDSS can aid the nursing practice. An off-the-shelf handheld computer is utilized to deliver clinical knowledge to the nurse, via wireless link to a central server and a data repository. In describing the software architecture of the system, particular emphasis is paid to the issue of appropriate design by discussing the steps taken to address system extensibility, performance, reliability, and security, which are important factors in the design of a CDSS.}

Abstract = {Assigning effective teachers to introductory IS courses represents one intervention strategy that has been broadly advocated to help reverse the sharp decline in students majoring in Information Systems (IS). Using a survey of 305 students enrolled in a multiple-section introductory IS course, this study empirically confirms that students who are taught by effective teachers are more likely to be attracted to the IS discipline. Moreover, based on a robust theoretical foundation grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, the findings reveal the underlying mechanisms through which teaching effectiveness influences students' aspirations to pursue an IS degree. Specifically, teaching effectiveness bolsters students' confidence in their ability to successfully perform as IS majors (i.e., self-efficacy), raises students' expectations that valued rewards will be received by majoring in IS (i.e., outcome expectations), and helps students develop enduring interest in the IS field. In addition to teaching effectiveness, students with high self-efficacy and robust outcome expectations become more interested in IS. In turn, interest serves as the primary channel through which goals to choose the IS major develop. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.}

Abstract = {The emergence of the World Wide Web as a major communication and transaction channel stresses the preeminent importance of a company's Web site for representing the organization, interacting with customers and conducting transactions. In comparison to other channels, the opportunities for targeting specific market segments are somehow limited, due to the Internet's worldwide reach and predominantly anonymous users. Additionally, an ever-increasing number of customers are going online, which prevents the fine tuning of a site for specific user groups. Therefore, it seems essential that organizations possessing Web presence should be well aware of their site's general functionality and how it is perceived by Internet users. For many years the analysis of Web sites has been one of the major topics for both scholars and practitioners, which led to a huge number of different techniques being used for the evaluation of sites. Furthermore, a variety of different theories and models have been developed which include the effects of Web sites as dependent or independent variables. In this paper, I compare different approaches to Web site analysis and present a classification framework. Numerous examples will be given to illustrate the various dimensions of the framework. Furthermore, benefits and drawbacks of the respective methods will be discussed where applicable. The results provide important insights into the current state of the art of Web analysis and will be supportive for anyone planning to conduct a Web analysis as well as for someone who is interested in getting an overview of the research field.}

Abstract = {Ever since Odysseus, King of Ithaca, left to fight in the Trojan War and entrusted his friend, Mentor, to care for and educate his son, academic mentors have guided, educated, trained, and encouraged protégés in their academic development. As with Mentor and his protégé, mentoring relationships evolve over time in a predictable pattern and certain behaviors are necessary to initiate and sustain a mutually beneficial mentoring relationship. There are numerous parallels between successful mentoring behaviors in the academic and business world, and this paper seeks to leverage those similarities to provide advice for academic mentors and their protégés. This paper describes the stages of a mentoring relationship, discusses behaviors that underlie each stage and presents a series of best practices that future academic mentors and protégés should seek to emulate. While specific activities vary by stage of the mentoring evolution, mentors and protégés should create successful relationships, be respectful of time expectations and demands, ensure that necessary advisement occurs, and be open to an increasingly deep and personal relationship.  By understanding and applying these behaviors, academic mentors and protégés can learn from and extend the mentoring legacy of Gary Dickson.}

Gary Dickson has had that kind of impact on others. Gary also has left us with a discovery framework for survival in academia. Surviving academics must groom themselves for their careers through the use of knowledge that can be turned into action. Knowing yourself and your strengths and weaknesses, your field and its perception by other academics, key players both while in a Ph.D. program and in an academic position, success factors in the job market and on the road to tenure and promotion, your publication outlets, and how you personally react to criticism are all part of your desired "knowledge package." But, knowledge is not enough. You must use your information system and knowledge base along with an action plan to reach your goals. Actions including but not limited to a balance in life, turning unstructured tasks into structured ones, and thinking beyond system boundaries all can guide you to be a survivor in academia.

The article finally discusses the nature of EMPs (private or built in consortium) with transaction cost and resource-based view theoretical backgrounds.}

Abstract = {An analysis of 18,854 editorial positions on IS journals was undertaken to examine the perceived gender balance of those positions as an indication of their contribution towards a positive role model for females considering an IS academic career. The nature and extent of perceived gender balance is examined in terms of overall composition of editorial positions, journal prestige and the specific area within IS covered by a journal. The results indicate that perceived gender balance of editorial positions reflects that of ICT academia generally, and that female representation appears to be concentrated in journals covering areas that are traditionally seen as female occupations, e.g., health, education, librarianship. As such, little or no encouragement is given to females considering an IS academic career.}

Abstract = {Virtual worlds like Second Life offer players opportunities to earn real-world income through their activities in the game.  It will not be long before governments begin to establish policies and regulations regarding the income generated by players of these game environments.  This paper examines the issue of taxes in virtual world games.  Two alternative places for recognizing income could be established by regulators: 1) at the point when in-game transactions take place; or 2) when players convert game assets into real-world currency.  We argue for realization of income, and therefore taxation, at the exchange.  We expect that burdensome policies such as requiring game operators to monitor and report taxable activities to the authorities will dissuade game play and likely result in the collapse of these vibrant economies.   Therefore, our recommendation is that the IRS should establish specific rules that inform players about how they should calculate income and work with game operators to inform participants of both the rules and consequences for non-compliance.}

Using a data set of Information Systems articles that spans 15 years, we conducted a scientometric study of the field. The articles are drawn from three premier IS journals. We use citation analysis to demonstrate the impact of articles on institutions and individuals in the IS field. In addition, we identify IS topics with the highest impact. The results indicate that leading productive institutions have changed over time, and problematically, institutions outside of North America are poorly represented.

Abstract = {We all need ways to assess the quality of the information we look for, but this task is critically important when we are seeking health information. Healthcare consumers increasingly seek and use health information to address their health concerns. However, many health consumers lack the time and expertise required to make solid judgments about the quality of health information they encounter. A full range of quality appraisal methods for health information offer help, yet health consumers use those methods infrequently. Health consumers need better support to overcome barriers to efficiency, scalability, and transparency often associated with this breadth of valuable methods. Furthermore, they need ways to assess the quality of health information they find in the context of their own, individually situated needs. Our goals were to investigate the concept of health information quality and to explore how we can provide health consumers with better support by highlighting, rather than hiding, important aspects of health information quality. First, by reviewing and synthesizing criteria used by a broad range of quality appraisal methods for health information, we identified four focal characteristics of health information quality: content, reference, authorship, and publisher. Together, these four characteristics of intrinsic quality provide an organizing framework for health consumers to assess the quality of health information along multiple dimensions according to their own needs. Next, we used a user-center approach to design a prototype tool that concretely illustrates our framework by allowing the user to highlight multiple dimensions of health information quality. We present a usage case example of this illustrative tool, which visualizes the quality of MEDLINE search results. Our work provides a new perspective on health information quality by acknowledging and supporting consumers' needs for transparency and flexibility as they take a prominent role in health information quality assessment.}

Social network analysis is used to study the centralization dimension of the structure embedded in the data. The data concerns 385 employees of 36 firms within a group. Our empirical study first explores several possible assessments of power and centrality concepts; then, it tests a causal relationship between personal and organizational attributes of power and centrality indexes. Results show the relationships between personal characteristics, aspects of organizational power, and e-mail network centrality.

Abstract = {Users often use application software because of particular features. However, little remains known on whether user perceptions of application use is merely feature-driven or whether users perceive their application use as being more than an amalgamation of  features. As the software industry ushers trends such as Web services, it becomes evermore important for vendors and users alike to clarify how users perceive features and applications. The paper is an attempt to confirm whether users can perceptively unbundle application software features from the overall applications themselves. Using a modified version of the repertory grid technique, this study investigates user perceptions of application features using data collected from users in the design and development departments across five firms. The results suggest that user perceptions of overall applications overshadow their perceptions of independent features, suggesting application-level lock-in effects and pointing out the difficulty in vendor attempts to unbundle features from feature categories and applications. The study closes with a discussion of the findings and offering cues for future research.}

Information systems researchers have employed many statistical methods and tools for theory testing. However, very few statistical approaches are known to help researchers with theory development. In this paper, we introduce TETRAD as a powerful approach to aid researchers in developing and discovering new theoretical relationships. We illustrate the TETRAD approach by re-analyzing data from two articles published in premier information systems journals. The results from the previous examples demonstrate that TETRAD is a useful tool for uncovering potential theoretical relationships, especially when prior knowledge of underlying theory bases is lacking. We demonstrate that TETRAD is an effective and powerful statistical tool that can assist researchers in the iterative process of theory development.}

Abstract = {In this article, we apply transaction cost theory (TCT) and institutional theory to the realm of IS outsourcing.  TCT posits that firm's outsourcing governance is influenced by transaction cost factors, namely, bounded rationality, opportunism, and risk.  Institutional theory, on the other hand, has been advocated to explain non-choice behavior of organizations in the context of competitors, norms, and professional associations.  Although TCT has been used extensively in the extant literature to study outsourcing arrangements, we argue that as IS outsourcing practices propagate in organizational fields, TCT explanations will take a back seat to institutional explanations.  We appropriate the transaction cost framework to the IS outsourcing setting and consider when and how firm's decision to adopt outsourcing and corresponding ex-ante screening and ex-post monitoring of the vendor will be influenced by mimetic, normative, and coercive institutional pressures.  More specifically, we argue that greater the density and rate of adoption in outsourcing during innovation diffusion and stability stages, the greater the possibility that transaction cost factors will be replaced by institutional factors in explaining firms' governance structures (decision to adopt outsourcing, and corresponding screening and monitoring).  Conversely, we posit that when the institutional pressures are relatively weak, TCT better explains the intricacies of IS outsourcing arrangements.  In conclusion, future research directions and managerial implications of the institutional environment on IS outsourcing governance are discussed.}

Abstract = {How do CIOs decide which technologies to acquire and deploy?  This paper presents a set of criteria used by CIOs to vet technology decisions and spread their technology bets.  There is insight to be gained by defining, understanding, and applying these criteria.  In fact, the more we understand the technology due diligence process the better our understanding of technology leverage becomes.  Ultimately, the practice of solid due diligence processes is about the optimization of business technology.    There are at least 15 criteria used by Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to perform due diligence on prospective technology investments.  This paper describes these criteria and prescribes how they should be applied to technology investment decisions.  CIOs benefit from a disciplined due diligence process; technology vendors also benefit since investment decision-making becomes repeatable and predictable - and therefore more manageable; and those who analyze technology decision-making benefit from disciplined due diligence which enables a systematic analysis of the drivers of technology acquisition and deployment, as well as the development of due diligence effectiveness metrics.}

Abstract = {Higher education in the United States has recently come under pressure from federal and state legislatures for failing to provide "value for money" because of an alleged lack of accountability and quality [U.S. Department of Education 2006].  This article will argue that, contrary to this view, institutes of higher learning have a rigorous quality assurance and accountability mechanism in place, namely accreditation, and that, moreover, the recent shift in accreditation from an input-based approach to an outcomes-based approach has resulted in improved programs that prepare graduates better than ever before for the workforce and/or further studies.  These measures in fact are well applied in the field of information systems.  The paper focuses on accreditation and the role of accreditation in ensuring quality in education. The work of agencies that are of most interest to information systems programs, namely the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET Inc (ABET CAC) is reviewed.  The paper also describes a process to aid those interested in improving educational quality.}

First, we present wireless cell phone TV as a functioning multipurpose computer, or a "Swiss army knife," of media devices. The misconceptions are stated, influenced by preconceived notions by the media critics as well as users. Next we discuss a range of wireless technologies including wearable computing, ad hoc and mesh wireless networks as a means of providing communications for first respondents during a natural or man-made disaster. Then we examine the anatomy of motes and RFIDs, including sensors, in an era of ubiquitous computing and a world of (inter-)connected objects. Finally, we discuss the socio-cultural constructs impacting users' intentions to adopt future wireless applications.}

Abstract = {Issues involving method effects are routinely taught to PhD students in Information Systems (IS).  Unfortunately, the results of an assessment of a population of 128 survey-based studies published in three top IS journals over a six-year period (1999-2005) reveal that relatively little attention is being paid to method bias and that the threat of serious method bias is great in many of the published studies.  For instance, even the best-understood variety of method bias--common source bias--is found to have gone unnoted in over one-third of the papers that used a single respondent for all construct measures for reasons other than necessity.  This study was motivated by studies in other areas of the social sciences which have resulted in calls for areas such as IS to conduct empirical assessments of the frequency of the various forms of method bias.  Here, the myriad sources of method bias are reviewed and methods for minimizing or eliminating method effects, both in the design of a study and in the subsequent analysis of the data, are discussed.  Data on the frequency of appearance of a wide variety of potential sources of method bias are provided and conclusions are drawn.  A series of recommendations is made concerning creating greater awareness of method bias on the part of the IS research community and greater use of method bias criteria in the screening reviews of papers that are done by IS journals.}

Abstract = {Recent surveys of methodologies and techniques currently used in organizations for developing information systems indicate significant trends that call for a revision of the Information Systems (IS) Systems Analysis and Design (SA&D) course to define what methodologies, techniques, models, and tools need to be taught. Several course-related and environment governed trends seem to impact the coverage, including the growing popularity of object-oriented techniques, the shortening of the life cycle and the emergence of the iterative approach, the increasing adoption of the agile approach, the rising importance of UML, the outsourcing trend leading to global distribution of SA&D work, and the rate of change in the technical and business environments. The scope of the SA&D course has increased. Yet, most MIS degree programs have just one SA&D course. The typical SA&D instructor faces a number of difficult questions when trying to fit the much larger range of topics into a single course. A panel at the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) 2007 conference evaluated how the trends impact the coverage of the SA&D course and made recommendations on how these trends can be addressed. Based on the panel discussion, this paper tackles the many challenges of teaching analysis and design in the IS curriculum and taking it to the next level.}

Abstract = {The recent debate about crisis in the Information Systems (IS) discipline is largely attributed to its having a fluid discipline identity. Myriad conceptualizations of IS discipline identity have resulted in a plethora of unstructured and disconnected recommendations for the survival and growth of the IS field. It is therefore essential to have a theoretical framework which explains: What is IS discipline identity? In this study, we address this void in the identity literature. By extending and borrowing from the concepts of organizational and self-identity, we propose a theoretical framework for discipline identity and explicate its dimensions with respect to the IS discipline.  The three contextual questions of discipline identity about purpose, period, and place set the stage for an in-depth inquiry of the three constitutive questions (or dimensions):  periphery, perspective, and process, to provide a holistic framework for conceptualizing IS discipline identity. Further, we conceptualize IS discipline identity process as consisting of four recursive and iterative sub-processes: copy, consolidate, differentiate, and demonstrate (CCDD). We posit that an iterative hermeneutic focus on these four sub-processes is vital for the health of the discipline and neglecting even one of them will lead to an imbalanced identity structure. Through this paper, we seek to stimulate and further the ongoing debate on the topic.}

The initial phase was a study of workforce trends in IT client companies and was completed in 2006.  IT executives from client firms say it is critical to own business and project management capabilities, and they especially value them in their mid-level hires.  Technical capabilities are more likely to be externally sourced, but they are also sought in entry-level hires.   The second phase is a study of trends in service provider companies and is ongoing. Our preliminary results indicate that provider firms also value project management and business domain capabilities over technical capabilities.

Abstract = {In recent years the Swedish Police Force (SPF) have encountered greater demands on availability and 24/7 services when dealing with errands that are regarded as low priority compared to regular police work, e.g. collecting tips from the public. One attempt to meet these increasing demands was the development of a mobile communications platform that allowed the public to communicate easily with the SPF using their own mobile phones by sending SMS and MMS. The focus of this paper is on the early phases of development of this m-service, in particular, on the specific technical issues such as interoperability and standards used by the actors on the scene affecting the development of mobile information systems. The learning experiences are as follows: First, mobile communication platforms have a large potential for contributing to the field of emergency management information systems since they can be based on open and nationally accepted standards. Second, global and national standards for sending multimedia messages are not always truly standardized. Operators and mobile phone manufacturers make minor alterations and interpretations of the standard and thereby some of the benefits found in standards disappear. Third, when developing mobile information systems we suggest and recommend that the analysis phase should be enhanced compared to traditional system development, and it should address the interoperability between mobile phones on one hand and operators on the other hand.}

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an integrative framework based on dynamic models of the evolution of industries.  The main arguments are illustrated using the case of mobile TV.  One main assertion is that the value network of mobile data services is much more complex than that of previous "generations" of mobile services, in particular voice and messaging.  The new environment requires a significantly higher degree of coordination and integration between more participants in the value net and a consistent constellation of technology, policy and firm strategy.  Unless such compatible arrangements are in place, mobile TV will not take off.  The paper develops these themes theoretically and illustrates them with a detailed case study of mobile TV in South Korea as well as comments on the situation in Europe and the U.S.  The private and public sectors in South Korea were capable of producing conditions in which mobile TV could flourish.  Even so, significant challenges remain to create a financially sustainable mobile TV industry.  In contrast, in Europe and the U.S. major obstacles to the development of mobile TV continue to exist.  Unless these obstacles, including problems with spectrum policy, are addressed, mobile TV may not be able to develop its full market potential.}

Abstract = {This paper presents a model of the drivers of e-government maturity. We differentiate "maturity" from "readiness" on the basis that the former refers to demonstrated behavior, while the latter provides an idea of a country's potential to achieve e-government, and argue that maturity is a more accurate measure of a country's realized progress. We investigate the prevalence of affluent countries in many e-government rankings using a model where the relationship between GDP and e-government maturity is mediated by ICT infrastructure, human capital, and governance. Using data from authoritative sources, we find that most of the positive influence of GDP on e-government maturity occurs through ICT infrastructure. More mature e-government, however, does not necessarily reflect better governance; in fact our data show a weak but significant negative relationship between e-government maturity and the quality of governance. We suggest plausible explanations for these findings and how the future evolution of e-government might change the observed relationships.}

Abstract = {Since its founding in the 1960s, the Information Systems (IS) field has been involved in critical debates about the nature and future of the discipline.  Many researchers feel that diversity in IS research is our strength; others fear that too much diversity leads to losing the field's core identity. Do the scholarly contributions of the IS community reveal either of these two phenomena? In order to address this question, we examine articles published in leading IS journals (MISQ, ISR, and JMIS) during the period of 2000 to 2006. Our analysis includes classifying the articles using a classification scheme that includes the consideration of IT artifact, the research methods used, and the research topics covered. We provide descriptive statistics following a content analysis procedure and results based on cluster analysis and association rule mining. Our results provide an update on previous findings on IT artifact and its consideration in IS publications. Our results further suggest that while our leading journals cover a broad range of research topics and methods, there is also evidence of popularity on some topics and research methods.}

Abstract = {This case study concerns moral conflicts identified by instructors on a project course in information systems education. Students on the course in question are expected to acquire project-work skills through implementing a project task for a real-life client. Data about moral conflicts was gathered by means of participant observation and interviews, and a phenomenographical approach was taken in the analysis. Six types of moral conflicts were identified, reflecting two aspects of the phenomenon. The first relates to conflicts involving outside parties and task-related and human issues and the second to deliberation about performing morally wrong acts or upholding relations. The core problem area in the instructor's work became visible in the form of inherent role strains and the need to react to conflicting expectations from all parties. The underlying source of the strains was the clash between the objectives of the clients and the learning aspect promoted by the university. This and three other types of strain made the instructor's work mentally demanding and morally challenging. Recommendations for dealing with these moral conflicts and role strains are given. Finally, the study is evaluated against the principles laid down for interpretive research.}

Abstract = {Selecting an appropriate process modeling language forms an important task for organizations engaging in business process management initiatives. A plethora of process modeling languages has been developed over the last decades, leading to a need for rigorous theory to assist in the evaluation and comparison of the capabilities of these languages. While substantial academic progress in the area of process modeling language evaluation has been made in at least two areas, using an ontology-based theory of representation or the framework of workflow patterns, it remains unclear how these frameworks relate to each other. We use a generic framework for language evaluation to establish similarities and differences between these acknowledged reference frameworks and discuss how and to what extent they corroborate each other. Our line of investigation follows the case of the popular BPMN modeling language, whose evaluation from the perspectives of representation theory and workflow patterns is comparatively assessed in this paper. We also show which tenets of modeling quality these frameworks address and that further research is needed, especially in the area of evaluating the pragmatic quality of modeling.}

Abstract = {The shrinking student numbers in IS programs in developed countries has created a crisis for the IS profession. In this paper, we explore how offshoring is affecting the IS discipline both directly and indirectly and show some of the major causes behind the relocation of IS work. Our primary message is that while offshoring has impacted the location of some IS tasks, this has not led to the demise of the field. Indeed, in contrast to the public conception, the statistics show there are more IS jobs now than ever before in developed countries. We explore what can be done to better prepare the field for the offshoring challenge and to align the rather negative public perception of the future of the IS field with reality. While simple IS tasks such as coding can be commoditized and are therefore vulnerable to offshoring, other significant pieces of IS work (e.g., business modeling/IS business analysis) are "customer-facing" with high levels of complexity. The latter are less vulnerable to commoditization and consequently less likely to be offshored. We recommend that the academic IS community focus more on producing these customer-facing IS personnel that organizations will increasingly look for. We offer some suggestions for stakeholder groups in the field to address the key challenges they face.}

Abstract = {Churchman [1971] defines inquiry as an activity that produces knowledge.  He examines the epistemologies of five schools of philosophy from the perspective of general systems theory, asking the question as to whether each is suitable as the basis for the design of computer-based "inquiring systems."  He considers systems design and design theory in some detail.  We believe that Churchman's inquiring systems can form the basis for the design of knowledge management systems and that the IS research community has hardly tapped the potential of inquiring systems in that regard.  Mason and Mitroff [1973] brought inquiring systems into the IS literature early on, essentially making the work endogenous to the field.  We argue that building on inquiring systems can contribute to developing IS as a discipline by maintaining continuity in research and developing a theory that IS can call its own.  We believe that the lack of use of Churchman's work may be due to its lack of visibility in recent years and attempt to remedy that by summarizing the basics of the inquirers in some detail, trying not to interpret, but to remain faithful to the original. The paper encourages readers to study the original and develop their own notion of how the inquirers might be used in knowledgemanagement work.  There are probably as many different perspectives on how inquiring systems could support KMS as there are IS researchers willing to study them.  We would like to encourage a proliferation of such perspectives.}

Abstract = {In this dynamic age of corporate acquisitions, mergers, and enterprise integration, decisions concerning the evaluation and selection of information systems require comparing the functionality of each candidate system to the intended business activities that it will support. However, consensus on the definition of business activities used to support this evaluation is rare. What is needed is a referent business activity model that defines the business in a manner to serve as the basis for determining how well each candidate system supports the business. This paper 1) defines the referent business activity model concept; 2) provides an example from a case study of business activity modeling; and 3) demonstrates the utility of this model in defining functional requirements for selecting the optimal system from a set of 30 legacy systems to be used throughout the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Twenty-nine DoD business experts were able to construct a referent business activity model consisting of 65 business activities organized in a hierarchical manner. These activities served as the foundation for a questionnaire of 165 questions used to select three information systems out of the over 300 known systems that supported one or more of the 65 business activities. This experience demonstrated the feasibility of achieving consensus among business experts on one referent business model. It also demonstrated the utility of that model in evaluating legacy systems. This case provides a detailed example that business experts can bridge the gulf of ambiguous systems requirements that exists between real-world business activities and the information systems that support them.}

Abstract = {Mental models are personal tools developed by students to help them apply ideas they have learned to solve problems. If students are not required to reflect on the adequacy of their current mental models, they risk arriving at suboptimal solutions due to knowledge gaps or misapplication of theory. After critically reflecting on the capstone project reports from students in an undergraduate information systems strategy and planning course, we argue that our students require a deeper and broader understanding of alternative management theories in order to become more effective and creative problem solvers. Furthermore, students must be made explicitly aware of the existence of (and adequacy of) their mental models using techniques such as concept mapping and critical reflection. Our solution to the problem of knowledge gaps is not to "push" more content to students, but to enable students to "pull" new ideas into their mental models once they recognize their existing mental models are inadequate. An action learning approach that combines problem-based learning, student-centered inquiry, concept mapping, and critical reflection can help students self-diagnose and treat their knowledge gaps. This in turn helps students develop into more effective, creative, and motivated critical thinkers and problem solvers.}

Using conventional literature study techniques, we identify 105 articles that are considered to be highly relevant to eParticipation.  We develop a definitional schema that suggests different ways of understanding an emerging socio-technical research area and use this schema to map the research contributions identified.  This allows us make an initial sketch of the scientific character of the area and its central concerns, theories, and methods.  We extend the analysis to define four central research challenges for the field: understanding technology and participation; the strategic challenge; the design challenge; and the evaluation challenge.  This article thus contributes to a developing account of eParticipation, which will help future researchers both to navigate the research area and to focus their research agendas.}

Abstract = {Over the past decade management of information systems security has emerged to be a challenging task. Given the increased dependence of businesses on computer-based systems and networks, vulnerabilities of systems abound. Clearly, exclusive reliance on either the technical or the managerial controls is inadequate. Rather, a multifaceted approach is needed. In this paper, based on a panel presented at the 2007 Americas Conference on Information Systems held in Keystone, Colorado, we provide examples of failures in information security, identify challenges for the management of information systems security, and make a case that these challenges require new theory development via examining reference disciplines. We identify these disciplines, recognize applicable research methodologies, and discuss desirable properties of applicable theories.}

Abstract = {Business training and education are changing.  Organizations have experienced dramatic changes in their structure, competitive environment, and the demographics and demands of their employees.  As a result, organizations are seeking new and innovative ways to train employees.  At the same time the evolution of technology mediated learning tools (TML) has resulted in flexible, interactive, engaging, learning technology tools that promote experiential learning, analytical thinking and problem solving.  Simulation based technology mediated learning (SimTML) tools are gaining popularity in practice.  SimTML facilitates lifelike environments that utilize animated pedagogical agents (APAs) which employ nonverbal communication traits in their interaction with the user.  The effect is a lifelike, face-to-face interaction, between the user and the APA.  The result is a flexible, interactive, engaging, TML tool that promotes experiential learning, analytical thinking and problem solving.  This paper explores current SimTML technology, how we interact with learning technology, and provides selection and evaluation principles for organizations to use when evaluating SimTML tools for their own training programs.}

Abstract = {Every year, the Dutch Minister of Health promises that by the following year, all citizens in the Netherlands will have an Electronic Health Record (EHR). Until now this promise has not been met. One of the main requirements for realizing a national EHR is an interoperability framework, agreeable to the government, vendors and users. This paper first studies the demand side using the results of twenty two interviews with physicians, asking them about their core processes and their expected value of an EHR. This provides us with the adoption perspective on the EHR market. Next we look at the current EHR market, investigating the suppliers and their achievements and market share. Finally we take a look at the government side with an overview of the interoperability requirements dictated by the national IT-agenda for healthcare. The contribution of this paper is twofold:  o	First, our main conclusion is that success in the EHR market in the Netherlands is not yet motivated by interoperability requirements. o	Second, from a detailed analysis on micro level the following result stands out: A majority of the end users (demand side) do not get support in their relevant working processes.}

Abstract = {We present eighteen examples of mission-critical spreadsheets used by diverse people and organizations for application software development, financial risk management, executive information systems, sales and marketing business processes, business operations, and complex analytics. We argue the spreadsheet is a Rapid Development Language, an Integrated Development Environment, and a Fourth Generation Language, and has unusual challenges regarding source code protection. We note that intentional spreadsheet applications are largely absent from the error literature. We explain why people might prefer a spreadsheet to an application developed by the IT department, and show how some spreadsheet programmers choose to avoid--or do not have--an IT department.  We find that 1) Spreadsheets are widely used for mission-critical functions; 2) Spreadsheets are an effective application development platform; 3) There is diversity of development skill in creators of mission-critical spreadsheets; 4)  Sophisticated programmers sometimes choose spreadsheets over other languages; 5) Spreadsheets are amenable to formal development practices, but such practices seem rare; 6)  Spreadsheets play a central role in the evolution of business processes and work systems; and 7) Spreadsheets are a source of "accidental legacy systems". We provide the Skill-User Programming Paradigm to help interpret and explain our observations. We conclude that spreadsheets are vitally important to business, and merit sustained research to discover techniques to enhance quality, productivity, and maintainability.}

Abstract = {This paper reports a descriptive case study of the IS academic discipline in Australia. One in a series of nine papers comprising a special issue of Communications of the AIS (CAIS) titled "The Information Systems Academic Discipline in Pacific Asia," this sub-study sought to establish the "beginnings" of a cumulative and ongoing effort to track and report on, and reflect upon the evolution and state of the IS academic discipline in Australia (and Pacific Asia and ultimately other world regions). This paper clarifies the role of the Australian study as a preliminary to the larger Pacific Asia study, and draws upon a series of case studies of Australian states and territories to present the Australian situation. The case study protocol, based in Ridley's [2006] framework on the evolution of disciplines, suggests an inverse relationship between the impact of local contingencies and a discipline's degree of professionalism and maturity. Analysis of Australian data reveals considerable diversity in IS research and teaching across the nation, reflecting the wide geographic spread of universities in Australia. Although in general IS research is not highly contingent upon local exigencies and environmental pressures, the topics researched often reflected personal interests and are only weakly coordinated across research sites. At this time IS in Australia does not possess a unique symbol system that allows unambiguous communication between initiates within the field.}

Abstract = {This paper looks to the history of the development of Information Systems in Hong Kong as a contextual base for examining the Information Systems discipline in Hong Kong. The historical analysis highlights the newness of Information Systems as an academic discipline in Hong Kong, dating back little more than 20 years.  The study reports on data from eight of the ten universities in Hong Kong. All Information Systems groups in Hong Kong universities are shown to be located in business schools, with almost all groups having no separate Information Systems identity. Few Information Systems academics in Hong Kong are reported to have senior faculty positions. In keeping with the placement of Information Systems groups, and reflective of Hong Kong's status as a world finance centre, Information Systems curricula are shown to have a level of consistency across the state, with a heavy business component. By contrast, the study reports diversity in Information Systems research topics and research methods. Although the data analysed suggests that that the Information Systems discipline is immature in Hong Kong, evidence of a strong turnaround in ICT in Hong Kong and the recent establishment of the Hong Kong Association for Information Systems suggest a basis for boosting the status of Information Systems as a discipline in Hong Kong universities.}

Abstract = {Information Systems (IS) as an academic discipline is in different stages of evolution across countries because of different environmental and situational factors. In spite of thist, most previous studies on IS have been focused mainly in western countries, while scant attention has been given to understanding its status in non-western countries especially in the Pacific Asia Region (PAR). To address this shortcoming, and as a part of the Pacific Asia multi-country case study called IS-in-PA, this study explores the status of IS as an academic discipline in Korea by analyzing the characteristics of IS programs and IS research across 10 leading Korean universities. In order to do this, in-depth interviews and intensive secondary data gathering and analysis based on the case study approach were conducted. The results of this study offer a basic understanding of the unique aspects of IS as a discipline in Korean universities, thereby enabling more effective AIS initiatives to enhance the IS discipline in Pacific Asia, in general, and Korea, in particular. This can also serve as an early groundwork for other researchers seeking to understand the current situation and emerging trends in IS as a discipline in Korea.}

Abstract = {This paper examines the background and development of academic information systems as a field of teaching and research in universities in New Zealand, from its roots in the late 1970s until the present time. Interviews were held with key informants within the information systems departments in every university in the country, as well as one polytechnic institution which has recently applied for university status.  Based on the interview data along with other data drawn from the universities' Web sites and elsewhere, as well as the personal knowledge of the authors, individual case studies of each institution were prepared and validated by the key informants.  The paper begins with an overview analysis of the current situation and recent past, with a special emphasis on the student enrolment issue.  The information systems discipline is reviewed across the nine institutions through a detailed cross-case analysis including a number of summary tables comparing various statistics across all New Zealand institutions.  The cross-case analysis addresses issues such as the role of international students in IS, the comparative location of IS in the various institutions, and the overall "nature" of IS across the country.  The results of this study and analysis provide a unique perspective on the past, present, and future of academic information systems in New Zealand.}

Abstract = {The global downturn in demand for IT skills has not left Singapore unscathed. While the demand for information systems graduates has not been as adversely affected as that for traditional computer science ones, there appears to be a drop in the entry quality of students seeking to do information systems degrees. While there appears to be some turnaround on the horizon, to better prepare for the future it is timely to examine the current state of IS as a discipline in Singapore and understand what might be the driving forces that shape it. Using Whitley's theory of scientific change as a theoretical framework [1984a, 1984b], this case study seeks to explore the degree of professionalization and the maturity of IS as a discipline in Singapore through analysis of data gathered from in-depth interviews and secondary data sources. It is found that of the four constructs proposed by Whitley for determining if a discipline is a mature, distinct scientific one, the IS discipline in Singapore clearly satisfies three: the discipline has a high level of professionalization, strong scientific reputation, and well-established research competence and skills. While the IS researchers agree that the discipline has a common vocabulary with which to communicate with one another, they also agree that it is not unknown to the researchers outside the discipline and thus, in this aspect, the discipline only satisfies part of the fourth construct in Whitley's theory.}

Most graduates have no problem finding jobs in high-tech manufacturing or service industries. This study explores the status of IS as a discipline in Taiwan by analyzing historical data collected from the IS professional association - the Chinese Association of Information Management (CSIM) and by examining characteristics of IS programs and IS research across 9 top-tier Taiwan universities. The findings indicate that the IS discipline is highly professionalized and is identified as a separate and mature field that enjoys a high level of respect in Taiwanese universities.}

Abstract = {Global sourcing of software development has imposed new skill requirements on Information Technology (IT) personnel. In the U.S., this has resulted in a paradigm shift from technical to softer skills such as communications and virtual team management. Higher education institutions must, consequently, initiate innovative curriculum transformations to better prepare students for these emerging workforce needs. This paper describes one such venture between MU, U.S.A. and MDI, India, wherein IT students at MU collaborated with Management Information Systems (MIS) students at MDI on an offshore software development project. The class environment replicated an offshore client/vendor relationship in a fully virtual setting while integrating communications and virtual team management with traditional IT project management principles. Course measures indicated that students benefited from this project, gained first-hand experience in the process of software offshoring, and learned skills critical for conduct of global business. For faculty considering such initiatives, we describe the design and administration of this class over two semesters, lessons learned from our engagement, and factors critical to success of such initiatives and those detrimental to their sustenance.}

Abstract = {Having quality information is crucial for effective operations and decision making within organisations. The InfoQual framework provides a sound theoretical basis for defining information quality at three levels: syntactic (form), semantic (content), and pragmatic (usage). Objective measures can be defined for the syntactic and semantic levels. In this paper, we focus on the pragmatic level by developing and empirically testing an instrument that aims to measure subjective aspects of information quality based on the perceptions of information consumers. In combination, such a framework and instrument have the potential to aid organizations in identifying problems and planning improvement strategies for information quality}

Abstract = {Service-Oriented Architecture(SOA) is primarily regarded as a technical architecture consisting of tools and service specification to build loosely coupled applications. At another level it is also a means to leverage flexibility and agility to system services as it offers a hierarchical framework to coordinate simultaneous business process design and implementations using loosely coupled service infrastructures. SOA has been debated both in the academy and industry and misinterpretations of its nature impede its adoption. We summarize its historical origins and current evolutions. We review technologies that underlie SOA. In particular, we address how to integrate SOA initiatives with current technology platforms, and how to enforce reuse during the design of loosely coupled systems. We also analyze SOA design methodologies and platforms, and what are their roles in the application integration. Finally we outline challenges and future research directions for SOA.}

Abstract = {Recent developments in the field of integration technologies like Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) have emerged to support organizations towards improving the quality of services and reducing integration costs. Despite the importance of EAI, there is limited empirical research reported on its adoption in the healthcare sector. Khoumbati et al. [2006] developed a model for the evaluation of EAI in healthcare organizations. In doing so, the causal interrelationship of EAI adoption factors was identified by using fuzzy cognitive mapping. This paper is a progression of previous work in the area and seeks to contribute by validating the model through a different case environment. Thus, this paper contributes by deriving and proposing the MAESTRO model for EAI adoption. MAESTRO identifies a set of factors that influence EAI adoption and it is evaluated through a real-life case study. It provides an understanding of the EAI adoption process through its grounding on empirical data. In doing so, the MAESTRO model supports the management of healthcare organizations during the decision-making process for EAI adoption.}

Abstract = {This paper focuses on Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) adoption in healthcare organisations. EAI has emerged to support organisations overcoming their integration problems, and it has been adopted by many sectors. Despite its importance, the healthcare sector develops EAI solutions at a slower pace and can be characterised as a laggard compared to other sectors. The small number of EAI applications in healthcare has resulted in limited research in this area, with many issues requiring further investigation. The normative literature analyses the factors that influence EAI adoption in healthcare but it has not yet explored the role of actors during the adoption process. This paper makes a step forward and contributes to the body of knowledge as it: (a) highlights the role of healthcare actors and attitudes towards EAI adoption; (b) introduces an actor-oriented approach; (c) identifies those actors involved in this process; and (d) combines the actor-oriented approach with the factors influencing EAI adoption. The authors believe that such an approach is significant and novel as it: (a) enhances existing EAI adoption models by incorporating an actor-oriented analysis; and (b) facilitates healthcare organisations in making robust decisions for EAI adoption. The authors discuss the application of their approach through a hospital case study. While a single case study alone cannot be proof, the engagement of the actors was encouraging.}

Test subjects were paramedics from a large metropolitan area. Cognitive style of the paramedics was determined, along with their individual learning curve when transitioning from a paper medical record to an electronic medical record. Results indicate Kirton’s proposition of equal performance between adaptors and innovators was only supported during stable periods. There was no statistically significant difference between adaptors and innovators either before implementation of the new system or post-stabilization. However, following system implementation, adaptors and innovators differed significantly with regard to their initial change in task completion times, pattern of learning, and the number of days required to reach stabilization.}

Abstract = {The bursting of the dot com bubble in March 2000 caused firms to be wary about investment in, and the use of, information technologies. Consequently, demand in technology-related jobs dropped significantly. This drop in demand has had a profound negative impact on the demand for information systems (IS) courses in the tertiary education sector. Some IS departments suffered badly, and some were forced to downsize their faculty through attrition, giving back faculty lines, freezing hiring, or releasing faculty. At the same time, there has been significant and sustained growth in demand for accounting programs. Professional accounting bodies have introduced technologies to accountants and auditors, and technologies have gained its significance in the accounting discipline. With such an observation, this paper explores whether accounting students see IS courses as a complement to their program and the chance to offer IS-related courses to accounting students. We administrated a survey to explore accounting students’ preferences for accounting-related disciplines. We then conducted a number of focus groups to gain an understanding of their expectations and interest in technology-related courses. We found that although accounting students preferred finance courses to IS courses, they were interested in IS and considered IS to be useful to their long-term career. We then proposed several IS courses customized for accounting students. This will open up more teaching opportunities for IS academics, and strengthens the IS programs by providing stability in an otherwise unstable environment. After the rationale for a list of proposed IS-related courses for accounting students, we discussed some issues that IS academics should pay attention to before launching these courses.}

Abstract = {The model of an anytime-anywhere workforce is changing the landscape of business today. Increasingly employees are being emancipated from their traditional offices by the widespread infiltration of technologies that facilitate this model. The question is, how can we characterize the culture developing in support of these new ways of working and how can they be cultivated? Understanding this “ nomadic culture ” is critical to both researchers and practitioners. Due to the newness of these technologies and the speed of their integration into today’s work practices, prior research lends little direction in understanding this developing culture. This research contributes by proposing and validating a multidimensional model of nomadic culture. The model describes nomadic culture in terms of three levels: underlying assumptions, espoused values, and artifacts. Each level is then described more specifically by eight measurable nomadic culture sub-constructs. Using the Structural Equation Modeling technique, proposed relationships among the sub-constructs are tested along with the effect of organizational support for nomadic behaviors on employee job satisfaction. Significant support for the model was found in data collected from 203 working IT professionals from a wide variety of organizations. Suggestions for future research as well as implications for practice are provided.}

Abstract = {Currently, the companies that have introduced the ERP system in Taiwan are mostly large enterprises. Due to the high cost of introduction and uncertain performance, however, ordinary small- and medium-sized enterprises can hardly afford the system. Thus, not only would a reference model for ERP life offer cycle-wide management support and assist large enterprises in evaluating and renewing the system, but it would also offer small- and medium-sized enterprises a set of procedures to successfully introduce the ERP system. The objective of this research is to explore the life cycle-wide management and support activities of an ERP system in order to establish a managerial model which can be used as a guideline for managers in dealing with their critical managerial activities. This study applied both the results from the literature review and Delphi study on the basis of Gowin's Vee Approach. Through literature review, this research initially determined the life cycle-wide activities of the ERP system and then used the Grounded Theory to develop a prototype of the reference model for ERP life cycle-wide management and support. Subsequently, this study used the Delphi Method to collect the opinions of field experts. After analyzing and organizing the results, comparison and amendments were made to propose a final set of reference models for ERP life cycle-wide management and support. From the perspective of academic research, the authors believe that this study contributes to the development of a managerial model and provides prospective researchers with future directions in this subject area. As for the business sector, this managerial model can assist large enterprises through a better approach in management and support of the current ERP system, while small- and medium-sized enterprises are provided with a set of concrete steps to facilitate the successful introduction of the ERP system.}

Abstract = {There is a general need to understand better how context can affect evaluation, usage, and productivity of IT in research and practical settings. This paper investigates how perceived effectiveness of e-mail-style computer-mediated communication (CMC) differs between work and non-work contexts of use, and contrasts these differences with perceived effectiveness of face-to-face communication (FtFC). From the prior literature, we identified seven major activity domains that are prominent in CMC research. We developed a set of activity scales and corresponding measures of normative cognitive effort (NCE) for these domains and conducted an initial study to evaluate the overall instrument. In a second study, we measured perceived effectiveness of the communication mode within each activity domain among subjects who had communicated via e-mail and FtFC over a 15-week period. Some subjects communicated to support team-based software development (work context), and others communicated for personal interest (non-work context). We find communication technologies, activities, and contexts of use jointly determine perceived effectiveness; context influences perceived effectiveness primarily through interactions; and NCE successfully predicts perceived effectiveness based upon normative differences among activities. Our findings extend prior research in the area of task-technology fit to incorporate context effects, suggest that context is an important consideration in designing research, and introduce NCE as a method for predicting fit that can be applied even prior to system design. We conclude that the differential effects of work vs. non-work contexts are too large to be ignored, and we recommend an increased focus on context effects in CMC research and practice.}

Abstract = {Information Systems (IS) is not a homogeneous discipline. Rather, it is comprised of various communities that are characterized by different perspectives and methods. With regard to the ongoing discussion about the profile of the discipline, this is a remarkable phenomenon. More specifically, it recommends analyzing the characteristic features of the various IS communities and explaining the diverse paths of development they took. Furthermore, it implies the question whether—and how—the current diversity could be overcome in order to foster a more focused competition as well as a more coherent presentation of research results on an international scale. This article contributes to such an investigation. It is focused on a comparison of the international English-speaking community predominantly (in particular in its early days) shaped by North-American IS researchers, which plays a leading role in the international scene, and the IS discipline in German-speaking countries (”Wirtschaftsinformatik” or WI, in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland), which constitutes the largest IS community outside North America that maintains its own approach. The focus of this article is mainly on describing the communities’ characteristics as the outcome of a social construction that is chiefly influenced by those individuals who participated in this construction. Against this background, eight scholars from North America and six scholars from German-speaking countries were interviewed at length. All were chosen as witnesses of and important contributors to the development of their discipline. As a result of this reconstruction, the article presents a rich picture of the communities’ history and characteristics as experienced and reported by the interviewees. The results obtained from this project indicate that neither of the two conceptions (IS or WI) can serve as an ideal model. Instead, a more intensive international exchange among the various research communities, including the Scandinavian and British scholars, should contribute to further develop the field into a more mature and satisfactory state.}

Abstract = {Education is often seen as a route to full participation in society, and widening participation in education and lifelong learning as a way of including those who are currently excluded from many of the benefits of society. The use of learning technology (e-learning) is perceived by national governments, the European Union (EU), and academic institutions as a means of widening participation in higher education by enabling participation by nontraditional students. E-learning is perceived as lowering barriers of time and place to enable nontraditional students to attend campus-based education while accessing resources at a time and place of their choosing. Yet, there is dissonance between the espoused belief of governments the EU and academic institutions, in e-learning as a means of widening participation, and the reality of e-learning implementation. The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to the information technology, and those who do not. This research finds that the digital divide is not adequately addressed by higher education institutions, with some students financially unable to afford technology and broadband access, others lack the skills to engage with learning technology, and some are culturally less able to benefit from technological enrichment. It also finds gender and generational differences disenfranchising some students. In order to address this situation it will be necessary to first acknowledge that the problem exists.}

This paper explores the extent to which the use of ICTs replaces face-to-face interactions. The data was gathered by telephone interviews from a sample population of 2,500 company managers questioned over a five-year period between 2001 and 2005. The results indicate that substitution of face-to-face interactions by e-mail only occurs in a few organizations (< 15 percent of cases), while a quarter of the sample population felt that ICT use had led to an improvement in meetings. This appears to confirm the superposition effect of different media or the so-called “Napoleon effect.”}

Abstract = {The popularity of e-commerce can be attributed to open (and mostly unbridled) competition with minimal barriers to entry. Yet, recent surveys suggest a general lack of consumer confidence in transacting online. Such findings are troubling — pointing to probable inefficiencies in e-commerce. The question then is: what are these inefficiencies and how do they prompt such consumer uncertainty? In answering the question, this paper surfaces three core e-commerce inefficiencies: seller anonymity, lack of product transparency, and lack of process transparency. It is also contended that consumer uncertainty is not an intrinsic buyer characteristic. Rather, it is contingent upon the information specificity of specific products that consumers transact in B2C and C2C e-commerce. Tying together threads from behavioral economics, this paper offers a novel perspective toward understanding electronic market inefficiencies and its consequent effects on consumer uncertainty. Apart from proposing a model of consumer uncertainty in e-commerce, the study offers a preliminary empirical validation of the proposed model. Findings suggest that inherent Ecommerce inefficiencies of anonymity and lack of product and process transparencies cause consumer uncertainty. The findings further evidence how buyer uncertainty increases when planning to buy products with high information specificity, especially when product transparency is lacking.}

Abstract = {Recently, the role of outsourcing vendors in outsourcing projects has been attracting increasing attention. This would imply that the studies on outsourcing truly require an understanding of both parties, i.e., the vendor and the customer, to realize the expected benefits. Although such benefits are mainly determined by how the outsourcing process is defined and managed, limited research has been done on the outsourcing process from the vendor’s perspective. The objective of this study is to provide guidance to organizations that plan to outsource or have already outsourced their IT functions in order for them to reap greater outsourcing benefits by understanding the vendor’s outsourcing process model. It also aims to assist vendors by exploring what key steps and concerns throughout the outsourcing process exist. To do so, this study develops a vendor’s outsourcing process model containing the type of vendor and structure of the vendor organization which comes strictly from the viewpoint of vendors. This is based on the author’s working experience and in-depth interviews with outsourcing practitioners in 15 IT companies. Such a model can provide valuable insights into the interconnection of vendor’s and customer’s outsourcing processes. Moreover, it can help customers and vendors expand their understanding of the outsourcing process from beginning to end.}

Yet, despite technological advances, the precise manner in which data-mining output should be incorporated into an organization’s decision-making processes remains unclear. This paper attempts to clarify the role of data mining by situating it within the context of Simon’s model of decision making. We use a complex decision problem from the video game development industry to illustrate several practical challenges managers face when using data-mining output as a decision making input. We then show how some of these challenges can be overcome by incorporating data-mined predictive models into a conventional decision-analytic formulation of the problem.}

Abstract = {We report results of a longitudinal case study in which an emergency medical service replaced a paper-based medical record with an electronic medical record system. The new systems electronically transmitted patient information to various other agencies for reporting, medical quality control, and billing purposes. As expected, the time required for the paramedics to document the medical record increased immediately after system implementation. As a result, operational performance of the paramedics declined. An unexpected consequence of system implementation was that operational performance never reached the level achieved prior to system implementation. However, the benefits attained by all organizations involved outweighed the prolonged decrease in operational performance of the paramedics. Therefore, we advise organizations implementing technology crossing organizational boundaries to consider both the direct and indirect benefits of a system implementation and to evaluate both operational and organizational performance.}

Abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an enabling technology that can provide organizations with unprecedented improved visibility and traceability of items throughout their journey in the value chain. This paper explores how RFID can impact traditional business models or create new ones. In particular, we propose an RFID business model framework and use it to show how value can be created for organizations, suppliers, customers, and business partners. We also identify the major dynamic phases of RFID and their corresponding impact on RFID business models. A taxonomy of 12 specific RFID business models is also presented, reflecting the wide spectrum of potential directions and applications of the technology. Finally, we present a case study to test the practical and theoretical relevance of our conceptual models. The paper outlines the need for technology managers to take a holistic approach to RFID business model innovation, taking into account the interrelated technical, strategic, organizational, and external environmental factors.}
